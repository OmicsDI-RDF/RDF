      <name>Long-range expression effects of CNV:  insights from Smith-Magenis and Potocki-Lupski syndrome mouse model</name>
      <description>To study the effect of structural changes on expression, we assessed gene expression in genomic disorder mouse models. Both a microdeletion and its reciprocal microduplication mapping to mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), which model the rearrangements present in Smith-Magenis (SMS) and Potocki-Lupski (PTLS) syndromes patients, respectively, have been engineered. We profiled the transcriptome of five different tissues affected in human patients in mice with 1n (Deletion/+), 2n (+/+), 3n  (Duplication/+) and uniallelic 2n (Deletion/Duplication) copies of the same region in an identical genetic background. The most differentially expressed transcripts between the four studied genotypes were ranked. A highly significant propensity, are mapping to the engineered SMS/PTLS interval in the different tissues. A statistically significant overrepresentation of the genes mapping to the flanks of the engineered interval was also found in the top-ranked differentially expressed genes. A phenomenon efficient across multiple cell lineages and that extends along the entire length of the chromosome, tens of megabases from the breakpoints. These long-range effects are unidirectional and uncoupled from the number of copies of the copy number variation (CNV) genes. Thus, our results suggest that the assortment of genes mapping to a chromosome is not random. They also indicate that a structural change at a given position of the human genome may cause the same perturbation in particular pathways regardless of gene dosage. An issue that should be considered in appreciating the contribution of this class of variation to phenotypic features.  Keywords: Genetic modification Comparisons of heterozygous mice carrying a duplication, Dp(11)17/+, a deletion, Df(11)17)/+, or both rearrangements, Df(11)17/Dp(11)17, with wild-type mice. Gene expression of at least two male individuals of each of the four genotypes were measured in hippocampus, cerebellum, testis, kidney and heart.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse pluripotent embryocarcinoma cell line P19 after sodium valproate treatment to investigate its mechanism of teratogenicity</name>
      <description>In the process of evaluating teratogenic properties of xenobiotica, the consumption of laboratory animals is high and costly which makes the development of alternative methods desirable. The pluripotent embryocarcinoma cell line P19, which closely resembles the early stage of an embryo, may be relevant as an in vitro model of teratogenicity. The antiepileptic drug Valproic acid (VPA) is a potent inducer of neural tube defects (ntd:s) in both human and mouse, but its mechanism of teratogenicity is not know.  P19 cells were here treated with sodium valproate in a both time and dose dependent matter to profile the gene expression response with Codelink UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarrays. This profile may reveal biomarkers of ntd:s as well as give mechanistic input of the teratogenicity of VPA.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - P19 mouse embryo carcinoma cells (ATCC # CRL-1825) were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 in Dulbecco&#x92;s Modified Eagle&#x92;s Medium (National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden), 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptavidin. Cells were split 1:10 every third day. 
 Sample Processing - Cells from four different subconfluent T75 flasks were seeded in four separated series in a density of 200000 cells onto 6 cm plates (Sarstedt) in 4 ml medium, and the next day the plates in series 1-3 were treated with 1, 2.5 or 10 mM sodium valproate by adding 20 µl from stock solutions; control plated received 20 µl water. Following 1.5, 6 or 24 h incubation, the plates were quickly washed twice with PBS, and the cells were lysed with 3 ml of Trizol reagent for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the lysate was stored at &#x96;70 °C until further use.
 Hybridization - 10 µg of biotin-11-UTP labeled cRNA was fragmented through incubation with fragmentation buffer for 20 minutes at 94&amp;#61616;C. Fragmented cRNA was then hybridized on CodeLink UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarray for 18 h at 37&amp;#61616;C at 300 rpm on a shaker. Excessive cRNA was washed off in 0.75x TNT buffer for exactly 1 hour at 46&amp;#61616;C and hybridized cRNA was stained with Cy5-Streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. After washing for 5 minutes 4-6 times in 1x TNT buffer and 30 seconds 1-2 times in 0.1x SSC/ Tween 20, the slides were dried by centrifugation at 640 x g.
 Labeling - According to manufactures instructions, 1 µg of total RNA, for each bioarray, was used for synthesis of double-stranded cDNA and subsequent cRNA, using CodeLink&#x99; Expression Assay Reagent Kit. In brief, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized with T7 oligo(dT) primer, 5 mM dNTP mix and reverse transcriptase at 42&amp;#61616;C and second strand was subsequently synthesized with 5 mM dNTP mix and DNA polymerase mix at 17&amp;#61616;C in a refrigerated chamber. Double-stranded cDNA was purified using QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and concentrated in a Speed Vac® Plus (Savant). cRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription (IVT) where biotin-11-UTP (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA) was incorporated into the cRNA. IVT reaction was performed at 37&amp;#61616;C for 14 h and cRNA was then recovered by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and assessment of concentration and quality was performed using NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cRNA was directly hybridized on bioarrays or stored at -70°C until further use.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Freeze stored Trizol lysates were thawed and separated by addition of 0.6 ml chloroform and subsequent centrifugation for 1 h at 4000 rpm. The upper aqueous phase were then mixed with 1.5 ml isopropyl alcohol and centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min to precipitate RNA. Total RNA were washed once with 75% ethanol and solved in RNase-free water and subsequently stored in -70 °C.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Feature Extraction - The microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon, Foster City, CA, USA) at 10 µm resolution. The photomultiplier tube voltage settings were sat to 600 V, laser power to 100 % and focus position to 0 µm. Images were analyzed using Codelink expression software 4.0.

      <name>Tumor suppressor role of Ezh2 in an NRASQ61K driven model of Early T-cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (RNA-Seq)</name>
      <description>Purpose: To characterize transcriptional changes associated with homozygous inactivation the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) lysine methyltransferase Ezh2 in a mouse model of earlt T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) Methods: We sequenced mRNA from NRASQ61K transformed murine LSK-cells co-transduced with a self-inactivating Cre-vector. Cells were sorted for Cre-expression (lox-stop-loxRosa26-YFP) or expression of an inert control vector (GFP) and differentiated on OP9DL1 stroma with and without a functional Ezh2 gene. Results: Inactivation of Ezh2 in this model leads to accelerated leukemia development. Resulting gene expression changes are complex and include enrichment of genes associated with immature hematopoietic cells, Ras signaling and Cytokines and their cognate receptors. Conclusions: Inactivation of Ezh2 in our model leads to accentuated expression of early hematopoietic gene expression programs and  to accentuated growth and survival signaling. Examination of mRNA levels between Ezh2ff and Ezh2ko in vivo, Ezh2ff and Ezh2ko in vitro.</description>

      <name>Expression data from multiple myeloma plasma cells and mesenchymal stem cells before and after co-culture</name>
      <description>To understand how interactions of myeloma cells with osteoclasts and mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow affect the clinical course of myeloma, we used microarrays to study changes in gene expression in freshly isolated myeloma plasma cells following co-cultures with osteoclasts (8 experiments) or with mesenchymal stem cells (13 experiments). Interaction with osteoclasts induced changes in the expression of 675 genes, and interaction with mesenchymal stem cells induced changes in the expression of 296 genes. Expression of only 58 genes commonly and similarly changed in both co-culture systems. Among these, we identified genes associated with overall, progression-free, and post-relapse survival, and developed survival prediction models. Gene expression data from 347 patients treated with total therapy 2 protocol, 433 with total therapy 3, and 98 patients who received various treatments (91 of them high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support) were used for the analysis. Good predictive models were developed only for post-relapse survival, using genes involved in interaction with osteoclasts or with mesenchymal stem cells. The best predictive model used expression of first relapse of 33 probesets whose expression changed in myeloma cells following interaction with osteoclasts, with hazard ratios of 24, 20, and 12 for patients who relapsed following total therapy 2, total therapy 3 and the various other treatments, respectively. Among the probesets used for prediction, only 10, representing 8 genes, were commonly changed after both co-culture systems. These could present favorable target for therapy.  Global gene expression profiling of primary multiple myeloma plasma cells (MMPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) before and after co-culture was done using Affymetrix microarrays. Thirteen MMPC and MSC co-culture experiments using MMPCs from 8 patients and MSCs from 5 healthy donors were performed.</description>

      <name>A systematic spatial bias in microarray hybridizations caused by probe spot position-dependent variability in lateral diffusion</name>
      <description>The hybridization of nucleic acid targets with surface-immobilized probes is a widely used assay format for high-throughput detection of many parallel targetsin medical and biological research. Though commonly applied, microarray technology still suffers limitations arising from problems of data robustness and reproducibility across platforms, stemming in part from an incomplete understanding of the complex processes governing surface hybridization behavior. It has been observed that there are non-random spatial variations within individual microarray hybridizations, but the causative mechanisms of positional bias remain largely unexplained. This study identifies a symptomatic spatial bias in surface hybridization signal intensitywith systematically increased signal intensities of spots located at the boundaries of the spotted areas of the microarray slide and characterizes the underlying mechanistic principle of this bias using a simplified block array format. Experimentally-derived hybridization dynamics are compared with a mathematical modeling analysis, which together showthat the driver of the spatial bias is a position-dependent variation in lateral diffusion. Numerical simulations employing a diffusion-based model are used to demonstrate the strong influence of microarray well geometry on this spatial bias and to determine optimal conditions for which this bias can be minimized or eliminated, resulting in increased uniformity of microarray hybridization. A simplified square array of 900 identical spotted probes was hybridized using different target concentrations and different time periods to analyze systematically spatial biases in microarray hybridizations.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Labeled RNA was added to hybridization buffer (6X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, 10% Denhardt’s reagent, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 15% formamide) and incubated at 65°C for 5-15 min. Microarrays were sealed with the HybriWell Hybridization Sealing System (HBW2222-FL, Grace BioLabs), which have a well depth of 0.25 mm. Static microarray hybridizations, i.e.without active mixing of the hybridization solution,were performedin a custom-made hybridization chamber at 42°C for 18 h, except for experiments testing the effect of hybridization time. After hybridization, microarrays were washed by shaking at RT for 5 min sequentially in a 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer and a 0.1X SSC buffer, followed by 20 s in ice-cold MQ water. Slides were dried by centrifugation (3 min, 300 x g) and stored in the dark at RT until scanning on the same day.
 Labeling - A 1.5 kB-fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of Desulfovibrio halophilus (DSM 5663) was amplified using the PCR primer set 616V-630R. The 616V primer contained a T3 promoter site tag at the 5â€™ end to allow T3 RNA polymerase-based reverse transcription labeling of PCR products. The target was labeled via an in vitro transcription reaction and template DNA was digested. RNA concentration and dye incorporation rates were measured spectrophotometrically, and labeled 16S rRNA was fragmented via incubation with 10 mM ZnCl2 at 60°C for 30 min and was then stored in the dark at -20°C.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Plasmids were used as template. Plasmid DNA was extracted using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer instructions.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Median Feature Intensity
 Feature Extraction - Cy3- and Cy5-labeled RNA mixed at a 3:1 ratio (900 ng and 300 ng). We analyzed the co-hybridization of Cy3 and Cy5 labeled RNA separately (without displaying the ratio).
 Image Adquisition - Fluorescence images were recorded by scanning the slides at 10-μm resolution with a GenePix Personal 4100A array scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Each pixel line of the selected area was scanned three times and the obtained signals were averaged to generate the fluorescence image. Gain of the photo multiplier tube was adjusted to record images with signal intensities just below the saturation level. Scanned images were saved as multilayer tiff images and analyzed with the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Low quality hybridizations were repeated.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human cutaneous B-cell lymphoma skin punch biopsies, mycosis fungoides (MF) and 3 normal skin biopsies</name>
      <description>We studied gene expression profiles of 17 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas that were collected with 4-6 millimeter skin punch biopsies. We also included tissue from 2 cases of mycosis fungoides (MF), 3 normal skin biopsies and 3 tonsils to create a framework for further interpretation. A hierarchical cluster algorithm was applied for data analysis. Our results indicate that small amounts of skin tissue can be used successfully to perform microarray analysis and result in distinct gene expression patterns. Duplicate specimens clustered together demonstrating a reproducible technique. Within the cutaneous B-cell lymphoma specimens two specific B-cell differentiation stage signatures of germinal center B-cells and plasma cells could be identified. Primary cutaneous follicular and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas had a germinal center B-cell signature while a subset of marginal zone lymphomas demonstrated a plasma cell signature. Primary and secondary follicular B-cell lymphoma of the skin were closely related, despite previously reported genetic and phenotypic differences. In contrast primary and secondary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were less related to each other. This pilot study allows a first glance into the complex and unique microenvironment of B-cell lymphomas of the skin and provides a basis for future studies, that may lead to the identification of potential histologic and prognostic markers as well as therapeutic targets.</description>

      <name>Genome-Wide Mapping of 5-mC and 5-hmC in severely Preeclamptic Placentas.</name>
      <description>Preeclampsia (PE) is a major contributor of maternal mortality with uncertain etiology. Recent studies suggested that epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, play a vital role in the development of PE. In this study, we have mapped genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosin (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) using MeDIP and (h)MeDIP in the placentas from severely preeclamptic patients and normal controls. A total 194485 pooled 5-mC peaks and 138133 pooled 5-hmC peaks were identified, of which 714 5-mC peaks and 119 5-hmC peaks showed significant difference between patients and controls (>2-fold, p&lt;0.05).To our knowledge, this is the first report of DHMRs (Differentially Hydroxy-Methylated Regions) in preeclamptic placenta. We not only confirmed the aberrant DNA methylated regions in the process of preeclampsia reported previously, but also identified unreported regions. A total of 4 selected DMRs (Differentially Methylated Regions) were also confirmed by MassARRAY EppiTYPER. Of these, PTPRN2, which had low level of 5-mC and high level of 5-hmC at gene body, was further verified to have lower methylation level at promoter regions in case group compared with controls. In conclusion, our study provided genome-wide distribution of 5-mC and 5-hmC in severe PE and normal controls, which have further clinical value for the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic markers for severe PE. Examination of 5-mC and 5-hmC pattern in 4 control cases' tissue and 4 severely Preeclamptic Placentas cases' tissue.</description>

 Library Construction - Genomic DNA of severely preeclamptic placentas and normal tissues was purified using the Qiagen Blood &amp; Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit (Cat. No: 13323) and sonicated. Illumina barcode adapters were ligated before hMeDIP. Adaptor-ligated DNA (5 μg) was denatured and incubated with 3 μl of 5-hmC antibody (Active Motif) or 5 μg of 5-mC antibody (Eurogentec) at 4°C overnight. Antibody-DNA complexes were captured by protein A/G beads. The immunoprecipitated DNA was purified and sequenced following standard Illumina protocols. Libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols</field>

 Feature Extraction - For the ChIP-chip data we performed a normalization step by an ANOVA model (Kerr et.al,2002) to remove technical biases.Let Yplfts be the log2 intensity of the probe s on the chip p and the array l, with treatment t and fluorochrome f.The considered model is: Yplfts=mu+ap+bl+abpl+cf+acpf+Eplfts, where ap+bl+abpl is the support effect (chip, array and interactions), cf is the fluorochrome effect, acpf  is the chip*fluorochrome interaction and the errors Eplfts are centered Gaussian variables.We estimated the parameters of the model and we removed quantified biases from the raw data.The IP and INPUT intensities for each biological replicate were then averaged on the dye-swap to remove gene-specific dye biases.To analyze data, we use ChIPmix, a method proposed by Martin-Magniette et al.(2008) that we have adapted to study several biological replicates simultaneously. The method investigates the relationship between IP and Input by a mixture model of regressions. For a probe, available observation are the two measurements IP and INPUT for the two biological replicates. These latter are assumed to be independent by definition. The (unknown) status of a probe is characterized through a label Z which is 1 if the probe is enriched and 0 if it is normal (not enriched).

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Post-translational modification of histones and DNA methylation are important components of chromatin-level control of genome activity in eukaryotes. However, principles governing the combinatorial association of chromatin marks along the genome remain poorly understood. Here, we have generated epigenomic maps for eight histone modifications (H3K4me2 and 3, H3K27me1 and 2, H3K36me3, H3K56ac, H4K20me1 and H2Bub) in the model plant Arabidopsis and we have combined these maps with others, produced under identical conditions, for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. Integrative analysis indicates that these 12 chromatin marks, which collectively cover ∼90% of the genome, are present at any given position in a very limited number of combinations. Moreover, we show that the distribution of the 12 marks along the genomic sequence defines four main chromatin states, which preferentially index active genes, repressed genes, silent repeat elements and intergenic regions. Given the compact nature of the Arabidopsis genome, these four indexing states typically translate into short chromatin domains interspersed with each other. This first combinatorial view of the Arabidopsis epigenome points to simple principles of organization as in metazoans and provides a framework for further studies of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms in plants.</field>

      <name>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of neurotransmitter receptor and regulator genes in 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mouse brain cortex</name>
      <description>The goal of this study was to identify brain cortex gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-060A) from SABiosciences. Mice used in this study were 4 week old males. Total RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates. For this study, brain tissue from 3 mice of each genotype was used and RNA from the cortex of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.  The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-060A).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Heterozygous MeCP2 A140V females produced in our mouse colony were bred with wild type male C57BL/6 mice to produce the male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous and wild type littermate mice used in these experiments. All breeding and experimentation was conducted in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.
 Sample Treatment - no treatment
 Hybridization - n/a
 Labeling - PCR assays were performed using the Mouse Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-060A) from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed from 1 µg total RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SA Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR using the cDNA was then performed on an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine using this protocol: 10 minutes at 95ºC followed by 40 cycles of (95ºC for 15 seconds, 55ºC for 40 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mice and their male wild type littermates (n=3 for each group). TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used to extract the RNA from homogenized brain tissue. RNA was then purified using the SA Biosciences (Frederick, Maryland) RT2 qPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit. Turbo DNA-free from Ambion (Austin, Texas) was used to remove residual genomic DNA from the samples. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA for each sample using SA Biosciences RT2 First-Strand Kit.

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Experiments used an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine. Ct thresholds were manually set within the linear phase of the logarithmic amplification plots using Opticon Monitor 3 software. Data from the logarithmic plots was exported and analyzed using the downloadable Excel PCR Array Data Analysis Template version 2.0 provided by SA Biosciences (http://sabiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php). This template uses the ΔΔCt method to establish the fold change between control and experimental groups. It also uses a two-tailed student’s t test to establish statistical significance using p&lt;0.05. A set of 5 housekeeping genes (Gapdh, Actb, HSP90ab1, Hprt1, and Gusb), which are included on the array plates, was used for normalization. This was done by subtracting the average Ct value of the housekeeping genes in each sample from the Ct values of the genes of interest in that sample. The 'non-normalized.txt' reports raw Ct values before normalization. The 'fold_change.txt' reports test/control (i.e., MeCP2 A140V/wildtype) ratios [available as Series supplementary files] ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized signal (against housekeeping genes)</field>

      <name>Gene expression study of blood monocytes in pre- and postmenopausal females with low or high bone mineral density (HG-U133A)</name>
      <description>Comparison of circulating monocytes from pre- and postmanopausal females with low or high bone mineral density (BMD). Circulating monocytes are progenitors of osteoclasts, and produce factors important to bone metabolism. Results provide insight into the role of monocytes in osteoporosis. We identify osteoporosis genes by microarray analyses of monocytes in high vs. low hip BMD (bone mineral density) subjects. Microarray analyses of monocytes were performed using Affymetrix HG-133A arrays in 80 Caucasian females, including 40 high (20 pre- and 20 postmanopausal) and 40 low hip BMD (20 pre- and 20 postmanopausal) subjects</description>

      <name>The expression of small RNAs after prg-1 mutation</name>
      <description>Piwi-related Argonaute proteins play important roles in maintaining germline integrity and fertility and have been linked to a class of germline-enriched small RNAs termed piRNAs. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two Piwi family proteins called PRG-1 and PRG-2, and PRG-1 interacts with the C. elegans piRNAs (21U-RNAs). Previous studies found that the prg-1 mutation causes a marked reduction in the expression of 21U-RNAs, temperature-sensitive defects in fertility and other phenotypic defects.To systematically demonstrate the function of PRG-1 on regulating small RNAs and their targets. We use recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology to show that expression of non-coding small RNAs in six stages(embryo,L1,L2,L3,L4,young audlt) and mRNAs in four stages (L1,L2,L3,L4) after prg-1 mutation. prg-1 mutation can not only lead to a decrease in the expression of 21U-RNAs, but also cause 35~40% of miRNAs to be significantly down-regulated; approximately 3% (6.00% in L4) of protein-coding genes are differentially expressed after mutating prg-1, and 60~70% of these substantially changed protein-coding genes are up-regulated. Examination of small RNA expression in six different developmental stages (embryo, L1, L2, L3, L4, young adult) and mRNA expression in four stages (L1,L2,L3,L4) of C. elegans prg-1 mutant (wm161) .</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines - kinase signature</name>
      <description>Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas (ALCL) represent a subset of lymphomas in which the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene is frequently fused to the NPM gene. We previously demonstrated that the constitutive phosphorylation of ALK chimeric proteins is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, and that ALK activity is strictly required for the survival of ALK positive ALCL cells. To elucidate the signaling pathways required for ALK-mediated transformation and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the transcriptomes of multiple ALK positive ALCL cell lines abrogating their ALK-mediated signaling by inducible ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or with potent and cell permeable ALK inhibitors. Transcripts derived from the gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis uncovered a reproducible signature, which included a novel group of ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNAi screening on a set of these ALK transcriptional targets revealed that the transcription factor C/EBPb and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2A1 are absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to sustain the growth and survival of ALK positive ALCL cells. Thus, we proved that an experimentally controlled and functionally validated GEP analysis represents a powerful tool to identify novel pathogenetic networks and validate biologically suitable target genes for therapeutic interventions. Experiment Overall Design: This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines (TS [a subclone of Sup-M2] and Su-DHL1) engineered to express ALK-A5 shRNA under a doxycycline-inducible promoter or treated with cell permeable pyrrolocarbazole-derived ALK inhibitors. A mutated ALK-A5M shRNA was used as control. Briefly, cells were transduced with pLV-DsRed-tTRKRAB, expanded, and used for transduction with pLVTH-GFP-shRNA lentiviral particles. Cells were induced with doxycycline (1 microg/ml) for 12 hours, double GFP+ DsRed+ cells selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells expressing GFP in the absence of the inducer were removed by a second flow cytometry sorting, and expanded. shRNA expression was induced by doxycycline treatment for 72 or 84 hours. Drug treatments (300 nM), were performed in TS cells with ALK inhibitors (A2 or A3), mock compound (A1), or control diluent for 6 hours. 5 micrograms of total RNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix HG-U133A chip following the manufacturer's instructions.</description>

      <name>Highly efficient derivation of ventricular cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells with a distinct epigenetic signature</name>
      <description>The generation of sufficient numbers of mature ventricular myocytes for effective cell-based therapy is a central barrier for cardiac regenerative medicine. Here we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived from murine ventricular myocytes, and consistent with other reports of iPSCs derived from various somatic cell types, ventricular myocyte derived iPSCs (ViPSCs) exhibit a markedly higher propensity to differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes as compared to genetically-matched embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or iPSCs derived from tail-tip fibroblasts. Strikingly, ViPSC-derived cardiomyocytes form up to 99% ventricular myocytes suggesting that ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs may be a viable strategy to generate specific cardiomyocyte subtypes for cell-based therapies. The enhanced ventricular myogenesis in ViPSCs is mediated via increased numbers of cardiovascular progenitors at early stages of differentiation. In order to investigate the mechanism of enhanced ventricular myogenesis from ViPSCs, we performed global gene expression and DNA methylation analysis, which revealed a distinct epigenetic signature that may be involved in specifying the ventricular myocyte fate in pluripotent stem cells. Total RNA was extracted from mouse ES cells,  tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs), ventricular myocytes (VMs), TTF-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (TiPSCs) and VM-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (ViPSCs).  Global gene expression profiling was performed using affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 gene arrays.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Mouse ES or iPS cells were maintained on irradiated MEF feeders in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential medium (GMEM; GIBCO), supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 55 mM b-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO), 2mM L-glutamine, 0.1mM MEM non-essential amino acid, 5,000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and LIF suppliment.
 Sample Processing - To dislodge the ES or iPS cells from the culture dishes, the cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin for 5 minutes at 37oC. Culture medium was added to the dishes to stop trypsinization. The cells were dispersed into individual ones, transfered to uncoated cutlure dishes and incubated for 45 minutes for differential plating to remove MEF cells. The ES or iPS cells remaining in the suspension were collected for RNA extraction.  Mouse tail tip fibroblasts and ventricular myocytes are derived from postnatal day one pups using standard protocols.
 Hybridization - The biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) was purified, fragmented and added to a hybridization solution containing several biotinylated control oligonucleotides, and hybridized to a microarray chip overnight at 45oC. The chips were transferred to a fluidics instrument that performed washes to remove cRNA that had not hybridized to its complementary oligonucleotide probe. The bound cRNA was then fluorescently labeled using phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE); additional fluors were then added using biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody and additional SAPE.
 Labeling - RNA was converted into cDNA using a T7 promoter-tailed olilgo-dT primer, and second cDNA systhesis was then carried out. The double-stranded cDNA was used as the template in an in vitro transcription reaction catalyzed by T7 polymerase and containing biotinylated CTP and UTP in addition to the for unmodified ribonucleotide triphosphates.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA MiniPrep kit (Qiagen) was used to extract total RNA for analysis.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = log2 (RMA normalized signal intensity)
 Feature Extraction - Raw data (.cel files) were normalized using the RMA method in affy (R/Bioconductor).
 Image Adquisition - Each cRNA bound at its complementary oligonucleotide is excited using a confocal laser scanner, and the positions and intensities of the fluorescent emissions are captured.</field>

      <name>Expression comparison of mutant EGFR-driven gliomas with relapse tumors upon mutant EGFR ablation</name>
      <description>To determine the roles of oncogenic EGFR signaling in gliomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we generated a novel glioma mouse model driven by inducible expression of a mutant EGFR (EGFR*). Genetic suppression of EGFR* induction led to significant tumor regression and prolonged survival. But in spite of the initial response, the tumors relapsed invariably and propagated independent of EGFR*. We used microarrys to directly compare geen expression of control and relapse tumors and identified gene sets specifically activated in relapse tumors. Control and relasped glioma samples upon mutant EGFR extinction were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The tumor suppressor gene MEN1 is frequently mutated in sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) and is responsible for the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) cancer syndrome. Menin, the protein product of MEN1, associates with the histone methyltransferases (HMT) MLL1 (KMT2A) and MLL4 (KMT2B) to form menin-HMT complexes in both human and mouse model systems. To elucidate the role of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) mediated by menin-HMT complexes during PanNET formation, genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) signals were mapped in pancreatic islets using unbiased chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Integrative analysis of gene expression profiles and histone H3K4me3 levels identified a number of transcripts and target genes dependent on menin. In the absence of Men1, histone H3K27me3 levels are enriched, with a concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 within the promoters of these target genes. In particular, expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) gene is subject to dynamic epigenetic regulation by Men1-dependent histone modification in a time-dependent manner. Decreased expression of IGF2BP2 in Men1-deficient hyperplastic pancreatic islets is partially reversed by ablation of RBP2 (KDM5A), a histone H3K4-specific demethylase of the jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 1 (JARID1) family. Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of Men1 in pancreatic islet cells alters the epigenetic landscape of its target genes.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - GNS and NS cells were cultured using serum-free basal media supplemented with B27 and N2 culture supplements (Life Technologies). Growth factors EGF and FGF-2 (20 ng/ml) were added. Culture vessels were coated with Laminin (Sigma) for 3 hr at 10 ug/ml prior to use. Alternatively media was directly supplemented with 1 ug/ml Laminin. GNS cells were routinely grown to confluence, dissociated using Accutase (Sigma), and then split 1:3 to 1:7. Medium was replaced every 3-7 days.
 Hybridization - Affymetrix Exon Array 1.0 ST arrays were hybridized at 45 deg C for 16h, washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE) conjugate on a FS450 automated fluidics station.
 Labeling - RNA samples were processed for microarray hybridisation according to the GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay (Affymetrix). 2 ug of each sample was depleted of ribosomal RNA using the RiboMinus system (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesised using random hexamers tagged with a 5' T7 primer, and the products were amplified with T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense cRNA. Reverse transcription was performed on the cRNA template using SuperScript III to yield single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation, substituting dUTPs for dTTPs, and the cRNA was subsequently degraded via RNase H digestion. cDNA products were then nicked with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) at sites of first-strand dUTP incorporation, followed by biotin labelling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by treatment with TURBO DNase (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
 Scaning - Microarrays were imaged on a GCS3000 7G fluorescence scanner (Affymetrix). Feature extraction was performed using Command Console 3.2.3 and hybridization quality assessed with Expression Console 1.1.2 (Affymetrix).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Exon arrays were processed using v1.28 of the xps Bioconductor package. Background correction, quantile normalization and calculation of probeset expression values from fluorescence data was performed using the Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) method and probesets were summarized by median polish.</field>

      <name>Toxicogenomic effects of sub-lethal exposures of organophosphates on mouse liver cells [mRNA Expression]</name>
      <description>In order to examine the long term effects of the OPs, murine liver cells (BNL CL.2, ATCC® TIB-73) have been exposed to sub-lethal doses of three OPs: diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) representative of sarin and soman, O,S-diethyl methylphosphonothioate (OSD) serving as a simulant for VX, and paraoxon as an example of OP insecticides.  Dosing levels of these compounds was set at 20% of the IV LD50 for each, with a 4 hour exposure time.  Gene arrays and physiological tests were run at three time points following exposure; 2 hours, 2 days, and 2 weeks.  The physiological results showed little to no effect upon exposure to sub-lethal dose of OPs.  Gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) profiles using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays and miRNA arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) found that the OPs did alter expression of genes related to several systems previously implicated in OP exposure with no long term effects.  In addition, a significant number of sRNA/snRNA and ribosomal RNA were found to be affected suggesting the need for further study of the changes in these regulators. Three biological replicates of liver cells were exposed to three representative OPs and then harvested at three time points (2 hours, 72 hours, and two weeks) following exposure.  These time points were designed for a determination of both early and late effects as well as identification of persistent, chronic changes.  The RNAs from the collected cells were extracted and processed on commercial microarrays to determine the gene expression patterns and miRNA profiles associated with response to exposure to the OPs.</description>

 Sample Treatment - Exposure to sub-lethal doses of three OPs: diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), O,S-diethyl methylphosphonothioate (OSD), and paraoxon (PX) were carried out when cells reach 80% confluent level. Dosing levels of these compounds was set at 20% of the IV LD50 in mouse for each, with a 4 hour exposure time. The final OP concentrations were: paraoxon at 5.4 uM, DFP at 49.6 uM, and OSD at 17 uM.
 Hybridization - The cocktail was hybridized onto the custom designed Vharveyi520694 microarray (Affymetrix). Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 49°C with rotation at 60 rpm. The microarrays were then washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the GeneChip 7G Scanner.
 Labeling - Target preparation and hybridization to arrays: 600 ng of mRNA contained PolyA RNA controls (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) with known concentrations to monitor the quality of the procedures. The labeling reaction was carried out in 30 uL reaction volume using KREATECH’s aRNA Labeling Kit (KREATECH Biotechnology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) according to the manufacture’s recommended protocol. Labeled mRNAs were purified and fragmented using fragmentation buffer from Ambion (Austin, TX). The fragmentation from the reaction was carried out in a volume of 33 uL containing 1X fragmentation buffer (Ambion), labeled mRNA, and incubated at 70°C for 15 minutes. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 uL of stop solution.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Liver cells were harvested using 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin-0.53mM EDTA solution or cell detachment buffer (40 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and the cells were span down at 2,000rpm, 10 minutes, the cell pellets were then resuspend in 1 mL of RNALater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and store at 4oC or -80oC until ready for RNA extraction. Total RNA extraction was carried out using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for total RNA extraction. The quality and quantity of the RNA samples was determined by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), FlashGel® RNA cassettes (Lonza Inc., Walkersville, MD) and spectrophotometric readings using the NanoDrop ND2000 (Thermo Scientific). The RNA samples were accepted for gene expression analysis if the A260/A280 ratios are between 1.9-2.1 and the ratio of intensities of the 28S and 18S rRNA are 1.5-2.5: 1.
 Scaning - The microarrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000. GeneChip® Operating Software 1.2 (GCOS 1.2) (Affymetrix) was used to acquire and process array images, determine the quantity and presence or absence of a transcript using the Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS5) algorithm, and generated the Report files summarizing the quality of target detection for each microarray.</field>

      <name>Histone methylation in wild type and ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings</name>
      <description>Histone 3 lysine 4 and histone 3 lysine 9 methylation in wild type and ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The purpose of the chromatin immunoprecipitation/microarray (ChIP/chip) experiment is to determine which regions of a genome are enriched for a particular histone modification in a single Arabidopsis thanliana genotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against dimethyl histone-H3 lysine-9 (H3mK9) or dimethyl histone-H3 lysine-4 (H3mK4) is performed on a selected genotype. This purified DNA from each immunoprecipiation (mH3K9, mH3K4, no antibody control) is used for random amplification to increase the quantity of DNA for microarray hybridization. The amplified DNA from each experimental sample is then labeled with Cy5 and hybridized against total input DNA from the corresponding genotype, labeled in Cy3. In a single hybridization, the total input DNA serves as a baseline and is compared to the immunoprecipitated samples. Ratios of normalized signal intensities were calculated to identify enrichment of a particular sequence after immunoprecipitation, in comparison to the total input DNA. Dye swap analysis is carried out to take account of experimental variation by repeating the hybridization with identical samples labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.  This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: GSE1333: EV49+50, Histone 3 Lysine 4 methylation in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1334: Histone 3 Lysine 4 methylation in ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1335: EV104+105, Histone 3 Lysine 4 methylation in ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1336: Ev106+107, Histone 3 Lysine 4 methylation in WT Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1337: EV51+52, Histone 3 Lysine 9 methylation in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1338: EV59+60, Histone 3 Lysine 9 methylation in ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1339: Histone 3 Lysine 9 methylation in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings GSE1340: EV110+111, Histone 3 Lysine 9 methylation in ddm1 Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings Refer to individual Series</description>

      <name>Domains of genomewide gene expression dysregulation in Down syndrome [RNA-seq]</name>
      <description>Trisomy 21 (T21) is the most frequent genetic cause of cognitive impairment. To assess the perturbations of gene expression in T21, and to eliminate the noise of the genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either up- or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins’ fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS and wild-type, also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina-associated (LADs) and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall LADs position was not altered in trisomic cells. However, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results suggest that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some T21 phenotypes. mRNA-Seq profiling in Down syndrome: fibroblasts derived from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 (4 replicates), iPS cells from the same pair of discordant twins, fibroblasts from a pair of normal monozygotic twins, fibroblasts from 16 unrelated individuals (8 trisomic and 8 euploid controls), fibroblasts from the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (1 trisomic mouse and 1 control wt).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from segments of umbilical cords from normal-term deliveries, and cultured in Medium 199
 Sample Treatment - Three condition experiment: DHA treated HUVEC cells (25 µmol/L DHA for 48 hours) vs control; IL-1 treated HUVEC cells (5ng/ml for 3 hours) vs control; HUVEC treated with 25 µmol/L DHA for 48 hours and then stimulated with 5 ng/mL IL-1β for 3 hours. For each condition, 3 replicates
 Hybridization - The hybridization procedure was conducted according to the Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol (Agilent Tecnologies ). Briefly, 825ng of the correspondiing Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNA were combined and hybridized overnight (17 hours at 65°C) to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays 4x44K (G4112F, Part No. G4112-60520; Batch No. 0006060953) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then air dried immediately.
 Labeling - 300ng of total RNA per each condition was amplified and labeled in the presence of cyanine 3-CTP and cyanine 5-CTP using the Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amp Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Dye-incorporation rate and cRNA output were quantified with the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and integrity were assessed using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Montchanin, U.S.A) and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) respectively. Samples with ratios of absorbance at 280/260 nm between 1.8 and 2.0 and at 280/230 nm between 2.0 and 2.2, and with RNA integrity number (RIN) of ≥ 9 were judged to be of acceptable quality and integrity to be used for microarray labelling.
 Scaning - Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505C) using two color scan setting for 4x44k array slides. Microarray slides were scanned at 5 uM resolution using an extended dynamic range (XDR)</field>

      <name>Glucocorticoid effect on mRNA translation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia</name>
      <description>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a central component in treating childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (chALL). They mainly act via regulating gene transcription. However, control of mRNA translation by GC has never been assessed systematically. In our research, T- and precursor B-ALL cells were cultured with and without GC for 6 hours and subjected to translational profiling, a technique combining sucrose gradient fractionation and microarray analysis of mRNA in different fractions. Analysis of GC regulation in different pools revealed no significant differences in regulation of mRNA translation by GC, suggesting no evidence for translational regulation by GC. Ribosome profiling by sucrose gradient fractionation followed by microarray analysis of RNA from 3 distinct pools representing free RNA (pool 1), RNA in small protein-RNA complexes or bound to single ribosomes (pool 2) and RNA from large protein-RNA complexes (polysomes, pool 3). See Material and Methods of the original article for a detailed description. Translational efficiency of genes was estimated by comparing the amount of a gene's mRNA in pool 3 with the total amount of mRNA of the gene (in all 3 pools). Translational regulation by GC was estimated by contrasting gene regulations in pool 3 with gene regulation between GC-treated and control samples in all 3 pools (depicted as transcriptional regulation). Moderated t-tests were used to assess significance for translational regulation.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - T-ALL CCRF-CEM-C7H2 and PreB-ALL NALM6 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2mM L-glutamine at 37C, 5% carbon-dioxide and saturated humidity.
 Sample Treatment - Cells were treated in 3 independent experiments for 6 hours either with 100nM dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) or 0.1% ethanol as empty carrier control.
 Hybridization - Target samples were hybridized to Human Exon 1.0 ST v2 microarrays according to the manufacturer's protocols in an Affymetrix hybridization oven.
 Labeling - Target RNA was labeled by addition of biotin-linked deoxynucleotides with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase according to the manufacturer's (Affymetrix) protocols. Washing and staining was performed in an Affymetrix 450S fluidics station.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL protocol according to the manufacturer's protocol, depleted of ribosomal RNA and transcribed into cDNA using T7-promoter-tagged hexamer primers. Antisense RNA was produced by T7-polymerase and transcribed into cDNA using random priming in the presence of dUTP which was used to enzymatically fragment the cDNA. The protocol for sample processed with Ambion reagents was identical to the one before (using Affymetrix reagents) with the exception that the ribosomal RNA depletion step was omitted, because specifically designed hexamere primer were used in the Ambion protocol, that preferentially do not bind to, and thus amplify, ribosomal RNA.
 Scaning - Microarrays were scanned in an Affymetrix 3000 scanner.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Raw data was preprocessed using the GCRMA method (option GSB.adjust set to FALSE). For transcript probe set definition, a custom CDF package was used, that was based on a complete re-alignment of the Exon microarray oligo-probes and annotation to Ensembl version 67.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Glucocorticoids (GCs) are natural stress induced steroid hormones causing cell cycle arrest and cell death in lymphoid tissues. Therefore they are the central component in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, in particular childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (chALL). GCs act mainly via regulating gene transcription, which has been intensively studied by us and others. GC control of mRNA translation has also been reported but has never been assessed systematically. In this study we investigate the effect of GCs on mRNA translation on a genome-wide scale.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Childhood T- (CCRF-CEM) and precursor B-ALL (NALM6) cells were exposed to GCs and subjected to "translational profiling", a technique combining sucrose-gradient fractionation followed by Affymetrix Exon microarray analysis of mRNA from different fractions, to assess the translational efficiency of the expressed genes. Analysis of GC regulation in ribosome-bound fractions versus transcriptional regulation revealed no significant differences, i.e., GC did not entail a significant shift between ribosomal bound and unbound mRNAs.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">In the present study we analyzed for the first time possible effects of GC on the translational efficiency of expressed genes in two chALL model systems employing whole genome polysome profiling. Our results did not reveal significant differences in translational efficiency of expressed genes thereby arguing against a potential widespread regulatory effect of GCs on translation at least in the investigated in vitro systems.</field>

      <name>Expression data from healthy postmenopausal women on 4 different types of hormone therapy, the RET study</name>
      <description>Postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) is associated with many diseases and conditions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of 4 types of HT on gene transcription. 24 women (6 women in 4 treatment groups) received 2 mg 17β-estradiol combined with 1 mg noresthisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mg 17β-estradiol combined with 0.5 mg NETA, tibolone, or raloxifene hydrochloride. RNA was isolated from whole blood before treatment (baseline) and after 6 weeks on treatment. The changes in mRNA from baseline to 6 weeks were assessed with a microarray chip. 4 treatment groups with 6 women in each group were blood sampled before treatment (baseline) and after 6 weeks on treatment, that is a total of 48 samples. The gene expression data at 6 weeks were compared to the expression data at baseline for each treatment.</description>

 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated from whole blood using the PAXgene® Blood RNA Kit 50 (Qiagen ref.762174). The total RNA was cleaned and concentrated to obtain smaller elution volumes using RNeasy® MinElute (Qiagen cat 74204).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = normalized and log2 transformed signals
 Feature Extraction - The data were normalized using the farms package (Hochreiter 2006) in R (version 2.10.1), using the RMA (Irizarry 2003) method. Probes were summarized using the revised entrez-based probe annotation of Dai (Dai 2005, the package hgu133plus2hsentrezgcdf.db, version 12.1.0), and classified as informative or non-informative using the method of Talloen (Talloen 2007). Non-informative probe sets were discarded. The latter two methods reduced the number of probe sets from 54,675 on the original chip, to 17,788 after re-annotation, and to 3,640 after discarding non-informative probe sets (filtered data provided as a supplementary file on GSE24859). Differentially expressed probe sets were identified using the limma R package (Smyth 2004) by subtracting baseline measurement for each patient from the measurement at six weeks, and compare the resulting expression differences between patients with different treatments using limma's moderated t-test. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate-controlling procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (Benjamini 1995).
 Image Adquisition - Arrays were scanned using GeneChip ® Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Image analysis was performed using GeneChip ® Operating Software 1.4 (Affymetrix)</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The genes FKBP5, IL13RA1, TPST1, and TLR2 were up-regulated and among the most significantly changed genes in the groups treated with conventional-dose 17β-estradiol/NETA and tibolone. Up-regulation of TPST1 was associated with reduction of tissue factor pathway inhibitor in plasma. Nine biological pathways were associated with conventional-dose 17β-estradiol/NETA, most significantly the pathways for asthma, toll-like receptor signaling, cell adhesion molecules, and MAPK signaling. Transcriptional changes with false discovery rate below 0.10 were found in 10 genes in the conventional-dose 17β-estradiol/NETA group, 7 genes in the tibolone group, and zero genes in the women on low-dose 17β-estradiol/NETA.

      <name>The DNA damage response transcriptome of the moss Physcomitrella patens</name>
      <description>The moss Physcomitrella patens is remarkable for the ease with which mutant alleles of any gene can be generated by highly efficient homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting. Targeted transgene integration is believed to be mediated through the capture of transforming DNA by the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. To identify components of this pathway in P. patens we have undertaken a transcriptomic analysis of the response to the sublethal induction of bleomycin-induced DNA double-strand breaks using massively parallel (Illumina) cDNA sequencing. Transcripts significantly increased in bleomycin-treated tissue include a number encoding conserved DNA-DSB components in both the homology-dependent pathway (including Rad51, CTiP, DNA ligase 1, Replication protein A, ATR) and the non-homologous end-joining pathway (including Xrcc4, DNA ligase 4, Ku70, Ku80,  PARP). Differentially regulated cell-cycle components include up-regulated Rad9 and Hus1 DNA-damage-related checkpoint proteins and down-regulated D-type cyclins and B-type CDKs, commensurate with the imposition of a checkpoint in the G2 stage of the cell cycle characteristic of homology-dependent DNA-DSB repair.  Comparison of the DNA damage transcriptome of P. patens with that of A. thaliana reveals significant up-regulation of a number of P. patens genes encoding ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling helicases of the SNF-2 class. These represent candidates for investigation of their role in mediating efficient gene targeting in P. patens.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Chloronemal tissue was grown on BCDAT agar medium overlain with cellophane for 6 days following subculture by homogenisation as detailed by Knight et al (2002)Molecular Plant Biology Vol. 2: pp. 285-299. Gilmartin PM, Bowler C (Eds) Oxford University Press.
 Sample Processing - Tissue was transferred into 5ml liquid BCDAT medium with or without 200ng.ml-1 bleomycin and harvested after 24 hours treatment
 Library Construction - RNA was isolated from a polyribosome-enriched fraction: protonemal tissue was harvested and residual liquid was squeezed from the tissue by pressing between two layers of Whatman 3MM chromatography paper. Squeeze-dried tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized. Three replicates of ca. 0.4g squeeze-dried protonemata, each corresponding to four 9cm Petri dish cultures were ground to a powder in liquid N2 in a mortar and pestle and homogenised in 30 ml 200mM sucrose - 200mM Tris-Cl, pH8.5 - 60mM KCl - 30mM MgCl2 - 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 - 5mM â-mercaptoethanol. The homogenates were centrifuged (20 min x 30,000 x g: Sorvall RC5B SS-34 rotor) and the supernatants aspirated and layered over 5ml sucrose cushions (1M sucrose - 40mM Tris-Cl, pH8.5 - 20mM KCl - 10mM MgCl2) and centrifuged at 150,000 x g (3h, Beckman Sw28 rotor). Following centrifugation, the pellets were each resuspended in 0.5 ml RNA extraction buffer for isolation of RNA by phenol-chloroform extraction Knight et al, 2002: Moss gene technology. In: Molecular Plant Biology Vol. 2: pp. 285-299. Gilmartin PM, Bowler C (Eds) Oxford University Press.) Aliquots (1µg) of polysome-enriched RNA fraction from chloronemal tissue were used for cDNA synthesis using the Clontech SMART cDNA protocol (Clontech Protocol No. PT3041-1; Cat No. 634902). Libraries were prepared according to the Illumina protocol accompanying the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of the Illumina adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3' end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 12 cycles and library fragments of ~375 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols.</field>

      <name>Chronic hypoxia in patients with colon carcinoma</name>
      <description>In Western countries, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in both men and women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (approximately 500,000 deaths annually). For CRC, the tumor stage is the main prognostic factor for survival or relapse after surgery. Current staging is based on the AJCC classification which takes into account tumor size/depth, lymph node involvement and distant metastases. Surgical intervention can cure a significant portion of the patients, especially those that are presented in stages I, II or III (around 75% of patients). Patients in stage II undergo surgery only, whereas stage III patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy. However, a major fraction of these patients either have no need for adjuvant treatment (40% stage III) or would benefit when they were given adjuvant therapy in stage II. Therefore, in the current practice, the majority of patients receive not the optimal treatment. An accurate and reliable method that identifies patients with low and high risk for recurrence could improve the selection for adjuvant therapies in these groups, reducing over- or under-treatment. Molecular profiling of mRNA expression by microarray is an approach to identify relevant genes and gene signatures and has been used already for different types of cancer, like breast and HCC. Most studies, however, resulted in their own classification with a specific separation into groups. Most of these microarray studies show remarkably little overlap and it is difficult to find a clear correlation between the molecular classes and prognosis. The results of the studies seem to be center-dependent because of the different microarray techniques used, the small heterogeneous cohorts that are studied and the different clinical parameters used for the evaluation. Recently, we used a mechanism-driven approach to find a correlation between gene expression in HCC and prognosis in which we tried to overcome most shortcomings (van Malenstein et al. CCR 2010). In this study, we want to apply the approach which we used for HCC now in CRC with the aim to improve the prognosis prediction for patients in AJCC stage II and III. We determined the gene expression by microarray in the colon cancer cell line Caco2 and identified the genes that are differentially expressed under hypoxia (72 hours, 2% O2). Using a bioinformatic approach, we used 5 sets of expression data with corresponding clinical information (training: 3 sets, 234 patients and validation: 2 sets, 322 patients). This resulted in a unique 21 gene set with good performance in retrospective analysis. A second improvement we wanted to achieve is the development of a method that can be applied on FFPE material, which would expand the use of the technique to samples outside the university or research setting. We used the nCounter technique that uses hybridization of labeled probes and quantification without an amplification step. We tested our 21 genes on a cohort of 384 well-characterized patients that were collected between 2004 and 2006 at the University Hospitals of Leuven. We compared cells under hypoxia 2% O2 versus 20% O2 conditions. This was done for two cell lines (Caco2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line and HPAC pancreas adenocarcinoma cell line). Each sample has a biological replicate. Samples are hybridized in dye-swap, resulting in 4 hybridizations per cell line.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - For Cy3 14 pmol and for Cy5 10 pmol incorporated dye was fragmented and resuspended in 55ul 2x GE hybridization buffer HI-RPM.The arrays were hybridized in microarray hybridization chambers (Agilent) overnight at 65ºC, rpm=10 for 17 hours.
 Labeling - From 1 μg of cellular RNA, poly-A RNA was reversed transcribed using a poly dT-T7 primer. The resulting cDNA was immediately used for one round of amplification by a T7 in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of Cyanine 3-CTP. The amplified and labeled RNA probes were purified separately with RNeasy purification columns (Qiagen, Belgium). Probes were verified for amplification yield and incorporation efficiency by measuring the RNA concentration at 280 nm and Cy3 incorporation at 550 nm using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Cells were seeded at 3x10^6 in 75 cm² tissue culture flasks (n=4) at 20% O2 and were grown until 70% confluence (during five days, with medium refreshment every two days). After reaching near-confluence, cells were washed with buffer and medium was refreshed. 2 flasks were placed in a humidified incubator with hypoxic conditions (2% O2, 5% CO2 at 37° C), while the other flasks (n=2) remained in normoxic conditions (20% O2). Cells were cultured for 72hrs in these different oxygen conditions, and after three days, cells were harvested after trypsin treatment, mixed with Trizol (InVitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and stored in -80° C for further analysis. Samples in Trizol were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer for RNA extraction. Thereafter, RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of all RNA samples was monitored by measuring the 260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Centreville, DE) and by means of the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Only RNA showing no signs of degradation or impurities (260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios, >1.8) was considered suitable for microarray analysis and used for labeling.
 Scaning - After washing, the slides were scanned with a DNA microarray scanner (Agilent) and images were processed with the Feature Extraction Software version 9.5.1.1 (Agilent).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - The Agilent processed signal values (i.e., features rProcessedSignal/gProcessedSignal from Agilent Feature Extraction v9.5.1.1) were used for the data analysis. Base 2 log-ratios (Cy5/Cy3) were computed, and in case of multiple probes for the same Agilent ID, average log-ratios were reported. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 Cy5/Cy3 ratio</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">In the CaCo-2 cells, 923 genes with a 2-fold change and Limma corrected P ≤ 0.0001 were found differentially expressed in hypoxia versus normoxia. We identified 21 genes with prognostic value and overlapping in three different training sets and (n = 224). With a fourth published dataset (n = 177), the six-gene Colon Cancer Hypoxia Score (CCHS) was developed. Patients with low CCHS showed a significant better disease-free survival at three years (77.3%) compared with high CCHS patients (46.4%; log-rank, P = 0.006). This was independently confirmed in an external patient cohort of 90 stage II patients (86.9% vs. 52.2%; P = 0.001).</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Hypoxia-driven gene expression is associated with high recurrence rates in stage II and III colon cancer. A six-gene score was found to be of independent prognostic value in these patients. Our findings require further validation and incorporation in the current knowledge on molecular classification of colon cancer.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Differential gene expression of CaCo-2 colon cancer cells cultured in chronic hypoxia versus normoxia was tested for correlation with prognostic variables in published microarray datasets. These datasets were further used to downsize and optimize a gene score, which was subsequently determined in paraffin-embedded material of 126 patients with colon cancer treated in our center.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Hypoxia is considered a major microenvironmental factor influencing cancer behavior. Our aim was to develop a hypoxia-based gene score that could identify high and low risk within stage II and III colon cancer patients.</field>

      <name>Genome-Wide Gene Expression Profiles in the Pancreatic Lymph Nodes of At-Risk Autoantibody Positive Individuals</name>
      <description>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a polygenic autoimmune disorder caused by autoreactive T cells that recognize pancreatic islet antigens and subsequently destroy insulin-producing β-cells. Pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) are an essential site for the development of T1D, where tolerance to pancreatic self-antigens is first broken and the autoimmune responses are amplified. The purpose of this study was to identify candidate genes and pathways in the PLN that may contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D. Microarray analysis was performed on the PLN of human non-diabetic healthy controls (n=7) and at-risk autoantibody-positive subjects (n=13).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Using the Agilent Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis protocol, the fragmentation mix consisting of 750ng of cyanine 3 labeled amplified cRNA, 50μ of 10X blocking agent (Gene Expression Hybridization Kit; Agilent Technologies), 10μl of 25X fragmentation buffer (Agilent Technologies) and nuclease free water to a total volume of 250μl, was incubated for 30 minutes at 60 degree Celsius and then 250 μl of 2X hybridization buffer was added to stop the fragmentation reaction. The 500μl solution was then pipetted onto the microarray and incubated in an oven rotator at 60 degree Celsius for 17 hours. Due to a high level of ozone in the lab, the Agilent Stabilization and Drying Solution protocol was used. Washing conditions include 1st, 2nd, Acetonitrile for 1 minute each and the 3rd wash for 30 seconds on a magnetic stir plate.
 Labeling - cRNA amplification and fluorescence labeling was performed using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies). The cRNA synthesis involved a single amplification for one-color labeling, to create ample cyanine 3 (cy3) labeled cRNA. In this technique a primer that contains poly dT, and a T7 polymerase promoter is annealed to the poly A+ RNA (mRNA). Reverse transcriptase is added to the reaction to synthesize the first and second strands of cDNA (to create double stranded DNA). Fluorescence labeled anti-sense cRNA is next synthesized with T7 Polymerase, which simultaneously incorporates cy3-labeled cytidine triphosphate (CTP).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit.
 Scaning - The arrays were then scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner laser based detection system. Background subtracted signal data (BGSub Signal: raw spot signal – background signal) and processed signal were obtained from images using the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 8.5.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Gene expression data were processed (cy3) and presented as normalized log2 (processed signal) using the limma package and ComBat, available through the Bioconductor project for use with R statistical software.

      <name>Deregulated Myc Requires MondoA for Metabolic Reprogramming and Tumorigenesis</name>
      <description>In order to investigate the effect of MondoA loss on the expression of Myc-dependent genes, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from TET21N cells expressing either control (siControl) or MondoA (siMondoA) siRNAs either with (NT) or without (Doxy) induced N-Myc expression. TET21N cells were grown in medium with either Doxy (Myc-Off) or No Treatment (Myc-On), then transiently transfected with either non-specific siRNA or MondoA siRNA in replicates. Cells were then lysed and RNA isolated.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The regulon of the sigma factor RpoS was defined in Geobacter sulfurreducens by using a combination of DNA microarray expression profiles and proteomics. An rpoS mutant was examined under steady-state conditions with acetate as an electron donor and fumarate as an electron acceptor and with additional transcriptional profiling using Fe(III) as an electron acceptor. Expression analysis revealed that RpoS acts as both a positive and negative regulator. Many of the RpoS-dependent genes determined play roles in energy metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, signal transduction, transport, protein synthesis and degradation, and amino acid metabolism and transport. As expected, RpoS activated genes involved in oxidative stress resistance and adaptation to nutrient limitation. Transcription of the cytochrome c oxidase operon, necessary for G. sulfurreducens growth using oxygen as an electron acceptor, and expression of at least 13 c-type cytochromes, including one previously shown to participate in Fe(III) reduction (MacA), were RpoS dependent. Analysis of a subset of the rpoS mutant proteome indicated that 15 major protein species showed reproducible differences in abundance relative to those of the wild-type strain. Protein identification using mass spectrometry indicated that the expression of seven of these proteins correlated with the microarray data. Collectively, these results indicate that RpoS exerts global effects on G. sulfurreducens physiology and that RpoS is vital to G. sulfurreducens survival under conditions typically encountered in its native subsurface environments.</field>

      <name>Post-licensing specification of eukaryotic replication origins by facilitated Mcm2-7 sliding along DNA</name>
      <description>Eukaryotic genomes are replicated from many origin sites that are licensed by the loading of inactive double hexamers of the replicative DNA helicase, Mcm2-7. How eukaryotic origin positions are specified remains elusive. Here we show that, contrary to the bacterial paradigm, eukaryotic origins are not irrevocably defined by selection of the loading site for the replicative helicase, but can shift in position after helicase loading. Using purified proteins, we show that DNA translocases, including RNA polymerase, can push budding yeast Mcm2-7 double hexamers along DNA. Displaced Mcm2-7 double hexamers support DNA replication initiation distal to the loading site in vitro. In yeast cells that are defective for transcription termination, collisions with RNA polymerase induce a shift in origin positions that correlates with the direction of transcription. These results reveal a eukaryotic origin specification mechanism that departs from the classical replicon model, helping eukaryotic cells to negotiate transcription-replication conflict. 4 samples: one replicate for WT at 37C, two replicates for rat1-1 at 37C, and one replicate for rat1-1 at 24C. All are single-end sequenced via Ion Torrent PGM methodology. rat1 = Nuclear 5' to 3' single-stranded RNA exonuclease; involved in RNA metabolism (http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000005574/overview). 4 ChIP seq samples and their duplicates are submitted. rat1-1 ORC ChIP at 24C and 37C; rat1-1 MCM ChIP at 24C and 37C.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Cells were grown at 24°C in YEP medium supplemented with 2% glucose. At optical density (OD600) 1.0, were continued to grow for two additional hours at 24 °C or 37 °C.
 Library Construction - Cells were croslinked with 1% formaldehyde, lysed and sonicated to obtain a DNA shear size of 100-800 bp. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with polyclonal antibodies against ORC or MCM (Gifts from Steve Bell, MIT *). Fragments were sequenced on an Illumina platform and reads were mapped using Bowtie and Bedtools. * Antibodies raised by Steve Bell group: UM185 (polyclonal anti-Mcm2-7) and 1108 (polyclonal anti-Orc1-6) Library was constructed by the sequencing core</field>

      <name>Gene expression analysis in polytrauma patients comparing sepsis vs. non-sepsis</name>
      <description>BACKGROUND: Despite best supportive intensive care, the development of severe sepsis and septic shock after trauma is still associated with a high mortality rate in intensive care units (ICU). Incomplete knowledge of the pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms that lead to perturbations of the host system is a major cause for this clinical entity. This lack of knowledge is mirrored in a delay in both diagnosis of sepsis and stratification of patients at risk. The current diagnostic and classification methods do not provide an early and reliable evidence for the development of sepsis and consequently lead to uncertainty in the classification and a delay in the initiation of an adequate therapy. Here, we present a prospective study performed with a well-defined patient cohort suffering from severe multiple trauma (n=85), in which we aimed to uncover the biological reasons why patients with multiple trauma can have dramatically different outcomes after suffering similar traumatic insults. METHODS: We used peripheral whole blood obtained with the PaxGene system at the time of admission to the ICU, i.e., 12 hours after trauma, for transcriptome analysis and monitored clinically the sequence of events from the admission to the ICU, to the very onset of sepsis and finally to the full development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Study protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding ethics, patient recruitment, logistics in sample acquisition and storage, microarray experiments, data analysis and data management have been developed and provided for a high feasibility and reproducibility of the investigations. FINDINGS: The transcriptome analysis from peripheral blood revealed a strong host response upon severe injury and demonstrated the suitability of whole blood in the PaxGene system as a surrogate marker in clinical gene expression studies. It was evident that patients who developed sepsis in the course of the disease (3-5 days after admission) showed an imbalance in the TH1/TH2 response towards a pronounced TH2 response, soon after trauma. The imbalanced TH1/TH2 shift along with inactivation of T cells, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages might be critical factors for the initiation of a septic program seen in these patients 12 hours after trauma. INTERPRETATION: First, in this study, we provide protocols for logistics and infrastructure that can be applied generally to successfully integrate gene expression analysis studies in a clinical routine and demonstrate that by following these protocols, dedicated and reproducible results can be obtained. Second, we showed that peripheral whole blood is a suitable surrogate marker for the host response as it contains lots of “information” and is easily accessible. Third, we identified mechanisms involved in the perturbations of the immune system that lead to sepsis.  Keywords: Prospective study 159 consecutive traumatized patients were included in the study upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), fulfilling all of the following inclusion criteria: severe injuries to at least two body regions or three major fractures, between 18 and 65 years of age, an estimated Injury Severity Score (ISS) of ≥15 points after thorough assessment of injuries, &lt;12 hours between the occurrence of the accident and the time of admission to the ICU, and at least greater than 3 days of survival. None of the patients underwent neuro- or cardiac surgery. We excluded patients with severe intracranial head injuries, coagulation abnormalities known at the day of admission to the ICU, acute renal failure, liver failure, malignant disease, or hemofiltration in the patient`s history. The Patients were divided into two groups depending on their posttraumatic course: Patients not complicatd by sepsis (Group: N) and Patients complicated by sepsis (Group: S). Using the CodeLink UniSet Human 10 K Bioarrays (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany), we searched for early differences in the transcriptome of these two groups. Only whole blood samples drawn upon admission to the ICU were used for this investigation. Microarray results were validated by quantification of mRNA by TaqMan® technology. Each patient sample was hybridized in duplicate or triplicate on microarrays (label-extract technical replicate). A total of 72 arrays (36 group N, 36 group S) were subjected to microarray quality analysis. Of these, 2 arrays (0 group N, 2 group S) were excluded from the data set due to quality reasons and a final set of 70 arrays (36 group N and 34 group S) were subjected to microarray analysis. Since the eliminated 2 arrays belonged to patients with three replicates, they were treated as two replicates in the further analysis. The arrays were designated N_xx_yy_z or S_xx_yy_z, with x for the patient-ID (1,2,3,4..) and z for the technical replicate number (1,2 or 3).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Purified cRNA was fragmented in fragmentation buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.9, 100 mM KOAc, 31.5 mM MgOAc) at 94C for 20 minutes. For hybridization on CodeLink bioarrays, 10 ug of fragmented cRNA in 260 ul of hybridization solution was added to each bioarray via the Flex Chamber port and incubated for 18 hours in a Minitron shaker incubator (Infors AG, Germany) at 37C, 300 rpm. cRNA was hybridized onto microarrays at least in duplicate (technical replicates).
 Labeling - Total RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis using a polyA-binding primer containing the T7-polymerase promoter (CodeLink Expression Assay Kit). Double-stranded DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquickTM PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany). For target labeling, the cDNA was in-vitro transcribed (IVT) by partially substituting UTP with bio-16-UTP in the reaction mixture. Labeled cRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The eluted cRNA was quantified with NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies) and quality was assessed with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies GmbH).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted from the PAXgene Blood RNA System (PreAnalytiX, Heidelberg, Germany) using the manufacturer's recommendations (PreAnalytiX). Total RNA was quantified with Nanodrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland DE, USA) and the quality of RNA was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies GmbH, Boeblingen, Germany).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Quantile-normalized log2 data
 Feature Extraction - A total of 26 patient samples were subjected to microarrays with at least two technical replicates per sample (total 70 arrays). Spot signals of CodeLink bioarrays were quantified using CodeLink System Software Batch Submission (V2.2.27) and Expression Analysis (V2.2.25) (GE Healthcare) as outlined in the user's manual. CodeLink Expression Software 1.21 generated background-corrected raw as well as median-centered intra-slide normalized data. The intra-slide normalized data were used for further analysis. The software automatically calculated thresholds for intra-slide normalized intensities for each array and flagged genes as TRUE when the gene intensity was higher than the threshold or FALSE when the intensity was lower than the threshold. Furthermore, the software flagged each gene value as GOOD, EMPTY, POOR, NEG or MSR defining quality measures. Only gene values flagged as GOOD or EMPTY were used for the analysis. Patients (arrays) were separated into two groups: A) 13 patients with sepsis in the latter time course and B) 13 patients without sepsis. Genes with missing values in  >= 50% of all arrays in a group were excluded from the analysis. Genes that were flagged as FALSE and GOOD or EMPTY in > 50% of arrays in each group were also excluded from the analysis. In this Dataset (Set1), missing values were imputed using sequential K-nearest neighbor (SKNN) imputation (Kim et al. 2004). To detect outlier values for a particular gene in a group, all gene values > median + 3 standard deviations (SD) or &lt; median -3 SD in a group were flagged as BLANK. Exempted from this rule were those gene values being consistently (more then 50% of a patient's technical replicates) > median + 3 SD or &lt; median -3 SD; in this case, the remaining values were flagged as BLANK since the consistency of these values in more then 50% among technical replicates of the same sample was considered as a biological feature rather than a technical outlier. All gene values that were flagged as BLANK were removed in Set1, which was then subjected to SKNN imputation. Finally, this set of 8551 genes was normalized using quantile normalization in R (Bolstad et al. 2003) and logged (base 2).
 Image Adquisition - Bioarrays were scanned using the GenePix 4000 B scanner and the GenePix Pro 4.0 Software (Axon Instruments, Arlington, USA).</field>

      <name>Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Epidermal Growth Factor on the Immature Human Intestine</name>
      <description>The inflammatory response of preterm infants' intestine underlines its inability to respond to hemodynamic stress, microbes and nutrients.  Recent evidence suggests that exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) exerts a therapeutic influence on neonatal enteropathies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of EGF remain to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of EGF on the gene expression profiles of the developing human small and large intestine at mid-gestation in serum-free organ cultures using Illumina microarrays. Differential functional effects of EGF along the human fetal intestine [Illumina] Transcriptional profiling of small and large intestinal explants cultured in the absence (control) or in the presence of EGF (50 ng/mL).</description>

      <name>RNA profiles of embryonic stem cells generated from in vitro produced or in vivo derived rhesus preimplantation embryos</name>
      <description>It is often overlooked that human ESCs are generated from in vitro cultured, often surplus/‘discard’, embryos considered unsuitable for transfer in infertility clinics. In vitro culture of preimplantation embryos has been associated with a number of perturbations, including ultrastructure, gene expression, metabolism and post-transfer development. We report here the transcriptional profiles characteristic of ESC lines generated from either in vitro cultured or in vivo derived embryos. Embryonic stem cell RNAs were prepared from samples collected from 8 different lines. Four lines were generated from preimplantation embryos derived in vivo (R series; Thomson et al 1995) and four lines were generated from in vitro cultured preimplantation embryos (Ormes series; Mitalipov et al 2003).  ChipInspector carries out significance analysis on the single probe level.  Normalized probe set level data not provided for individual Sample records. Processed data is available on Series record.</description>

 Sample Processing - None
 Hybridization - Affymetrix Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Protocol
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated from embryonic stem cell colonies using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), followed by further purification with a RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Feature Extraction - The data were analyzed with ChipInspector software from Genomatix using default analysis settings: Minimum number of probes that overlap with the genes is 3, fold change as threshold is 2 for identifying up/down regulated genes. ChipInspector interprets Affymetrix data with alternative way. It doesn't show each sample's signal intensity. Instead, ChipInspector gives the log2 based fold change ratio between two group samples for each gene. In our case, the log2 base fold change between in vitro and in vivo was given.

      <name>Defective NK cells in AML patients at diagnosis are associated with blast transcriptional signatures of immune evasion</name>
      <description>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies which may be sensitive to the natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumor response. However, NK cells are frequently defective in AML. Here, we found in an exploratory cohort (n = 46) that NK-cell status at diagnosis of AML separated patients in two groups with a different clinical outcome. Patients with a deficient NK-cell profile, including reduced expression of some activating NK receptors (e.g. DNAM-1, NKp46 and NKG2D) and decreased IFN-g production, had a significantly higher risk of relapse (P = 0.03) independently of cytogenetic classification in multivariate analysis. Patients with defective NK cells showed a profound gene expression decrease in AML blasts for cytokine and chemokine signaling (e.g. IL15, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, CXCR4), antigen processing (e.g. HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, CD74) and adhesion molecule pathways (e.g. PVR, ICAM1). A set of 388 leukemic classifier genes defined in the exploratory cohort was independently validated in a multicentric cohort of 194 AML patients. In total, these data evidenced the interplay between NK-cells and AML blasts at diagnosis allowing an immune-based stratification of AML patients independently of clinical classifications. Gene expression analysis were performed on CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells sorted from patients with impaired or normal CD56bright NK cells (n=2 for each patients? group) and from 3 HC</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The transhydroxystilbene resveratrol is found at high levels in red wine and grapes, and red wine consumption may be inversely associated with prostate cancer risk. To gain insights into the possible mechanisms of action of resveratrol in human prostate cancer, we did DNA microarray analysis of the temporal transcriptional program induced by treatment of the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP with resveratrol.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Spotted DNA microarrays containing over 42,000 elements were used to obtain a global view of the effects of resveratrol on gene expression. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and androgen receptor (AR) expression were determined by Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. Cell proliferation was determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry.</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We observed time-dependent expression changes in >1,600 transcripts as early as 6 hours after treatment with resveratrol. Most striking was the modulation of a number of important genes in the androgen pathway including PSA and AR. Resveratrol also down-regulated expression of cell cycle and proliferation-specific genes involved in all phases of the cell cycle, induced negative regulators of proliferation, caused accumulation of cells at the sub-G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, and inhibited cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner.</field>

      <name>Essential role of the transcription factors E2A and E2-2 in germinal center B cell and plasma cell development</name>
      <description>E2A is an essential regulator of early B-cell development. Here we demonstrated that E2A together with E2-2 controlled germinal-center B-cell and plasma cell development. As shown by identification of regulated E2A,E2-2 targets in activated B-cells, these E-proteins directly activated genes with important functions in germinal-center B-cells and plasma cells by inducing or maintaining DNase I hypersensitive sites. Through controlling multiple enhancers in the Igh 3’ regulatory region and Aicda locus, E-proteins regulated class switching by inducing both Igh germline transcription and AID expression. By regulating 3’ Igk enhancers and a distal element at the Prdm1 (Blimp1) locus, E-proteins contributed to Igk, Igh and Prdm1 activation in plasmablasts. These data identified E2A and E2-2 as central regulators of B-cell immunity. 56 samples in total: A) 38 RNA-Seq samples in 5 cell types: Follicular B cells (FO B cell, 2 genotypes, 2 replicates each) Activated B cells (Act B cell, 2 genoytpes, 6 stimulations, 2 replicates each) Pre-Plasmablasts (Pre-PB, 1 genotype, 2 stimulations, 2 replicates each) Plasmablasts (PB, 1 genotype, 2 stimulations, 2 replicates each) Germline Center B cells (GC B cell, 1 genotype, 2 replicates); B) 13 ChIP-Seq samples in 5 cell types: FO B cell (E2A, 2 crosslinking types, 1 replicate each) Act B cell (E2A, 2 crosslinking types, 2 stimulations, 1 replicate each; H3K27ac, 1 crosslinking type, 1 stimulation, 2 genotypes, 1 replicate each) Pre-PB (E2A, 2 crosslinking types, 1 stimulation, 1 replicate each) PB (E2A, 2 crosslinking types, 1 stimulation, 1 replicate each) Mature B cell (input); C) 5 ATAC Seq samples in 2 cell types: Act B cell (2 stimulations, 2 genotypes, 1 replicate each), Pre-PB (1 stimulation, 1 genotype, 1 replicate).</description>

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Peaks were called in the doublecrosslinked E2A ChIP-seq sample with a P value of &lt; 10-10 and in the corresponding singlecrosslinked E2A ChIP-seq sample with a P value of &lt; 10-5 by using the MACS program version 1.3.6.1 with default parameters, a genome size of 2,654,911,517 bp (mm9) and a mature B cell input sample (14951). Second, the overlap of the called double- and single-crosslinked peaks was determined with the Multovl program21 by using a minimal overlap length of one and allowing for all possible overlaps, with the results being parsed and converted to tables with custom-made bash, perl and R scripts. The E2A peaks identified by this overlap analysis were then assigned to target genes as described22. For comparisons of E2A ChIP-seq data between different cell types, we down-sampled all reads before peak calling to the ChIP-seq experiment with the lowest number of aligned reads. Thus, samples 22337 and 22338 (FO B cells), 22331 and 22332 (activated B cells, anti-CD40 plus IL-4, 2 days) were down-sampled to 27.1 million reads, and all other samples such as 22327 and 22328 (activated B cells, LPS, 2 days), 22333 and 22334 (pre-plasmablasts, LPS, 4 days), 22335 and 22336 (plasmablasts, LPS, 4 days) were down-sampled to 15.5 million reads. Concerning the ATAC-seq data, the DHS sites were identified by peak calling using the MACS 2.0.10 program. The peaks from wild-type and DKO cells were compiled. The peak regions were defined as peak summit ± 500 bp. Peaks were assigned to the genes as described for the ChIP-seq analysis. The read density was calculated as RPKM in each peak. For analysis of differential gene expression, the number of reads per gene was counted using HTseq version 0.5.3 (ref. 24) with the overlap resolution mode set to ‘union’. The datasets were grouped according to the performed stimulation experiments and analyzed using the R package DESeq2 version 1.4.1 (ref. 25). Sample normalizations and dispersion estimations were conducted using the default DESeq2 settings. In detail, the following DESeq2 analyses were performed: FO B cell and all anti-CD40 and IL4 stimulation samples were analyzed together considering the genotype, time and genotype over time effects (model design formula: “~ genotype + time + genotype:time”). The genotype over time effect for each day was then tested based on log ratio tests (with a reduced formula of “~ genotype + time). FO B cell and 2 day LPS stimulation data were also grouped and analyzed in the same manner. Three day LPS-stimulated activated B cell (WT and DKO), pre-plasmablast (WT) and plasmablast (WT) samples were considered for sample normalization, dispersion estimation, rlog normalization of the gene counts and the comparison of 3 day LPS-stimulated DKO vs 3 day LPS-stimulated WT activated B cells (Wald test). The 500 most varying rlog normalized counts (option blind) of the 3 day LPS stimulation dataset were used for PCA in Fig. 7d. In general, genes with an adjusted Pvalue &lt; 0.05 and a fold change > 3 as well as a mean RPKM (averaged within conditions) > 3 were called as significantly expressed. Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes were filtered from the list of significantly expressed genes and were also disregarded in the RPKM calculations. For the detailed expression analysis of the Igh and Igk loci (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 8), IghM, IghD, IghG, IghE and IghA were manually curated to provide detailed exon annotations and were split into constant, membrane, secreted, hinge and I exon regions. Ratios between secreted and membrane Igh transcripts were estimated by using the RPKM values of the secreted and membrane regions.

      <name>Expression Data from Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Cell Lines</name>
      <description>Activating mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA are present in approximately 90% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).  Although treatment with the KIT and PDGFR inhibitor imatinib can control advanced disease in about 80% of GIST patients, the beneficial effect is not durable.  Here, we report that ligands from the FGF family reduced the effectiveness of imatinib in GIST cells, and FGF2 and FGFR1 are highly expressed in all primary GIST samples examined.  The combination of KIT and FGFR inhibition showed increased growth inhibition in imatinib-sensitive GIST cell lines in the presence or absence of added FGF2 in vitro, and delayed tumor regrowth in vivo.  In addition, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by imatinib was not sustained in GIST cells.  An extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) rebound occurred through activation of FGF signaling, and was repressed by FGFR1 inhibition.  Downregultation of Sprouty proteins played a role in the imatinib-induced feedback activation of FGF signaling in GIST cells. We used micorarrays to quantify the gene expression levels in GIST cell lines. Four GIST cell lines were split and cultured overnight.  Cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays.</description>

 Feature Extraction - For the ChIP-chip data we performed a normalization step by an ANOVA model (Kerr et.al,2002) to remove technical biases.Let Yplfts be the log2 intensity of the probe s on the chip p and the array l, with treatment t and fluorochrome f.The considered model is: Yplfts=mu+ap+bl+abpl+cf+acpf+Eplfts, where ap+bl+abpl is the support effect (chip, array and interactions), cf is the fluorochrome effect, acpf  is the chip*fluorochrome interaction and the errors Eplfts are centered Gaussian variables.We estimated the parameters of the model and we removed quantified biases from the raw data.The IP and INPUT intensities for each biological replicate were then averaged on the dye-swap to remove gene-specific dye biases.To analyze data, we use ChIPmix, a method proposed by Martin-Magniette et al.(2008) that we have adapted to study several biological replicates simultaneously. The method investigates the relationship between IP and Input by a mixture model of regressions. For a probe, available observation are the two measurements IP and INPUT for the two biological replicates. These latter are assumed to be independent by definition. The (unknown) status of a probe is characterized through a label Z which is 1 if the probe is enriched and 0 if it is normal (not enriched).

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Post-translational modification of histones and DNA methylation are important components of chromatin-level control of genome activity in eukaryotes. However, principles governing the combinatorial association of chromatin marks along the genome remain poorly understood. Here, we have generated epigenomic maps for eight histone modifications (H3K4me2 and 3, H3K27me1 and 2, H3K36me3, H3K56ac, H4K20me1 and H2Bub) in the model plant Arabidopsis and we have combined these maps with others, produced under identical conditions, for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. Integrative analysis indicates that these 12 chromatin marks, which collectively cover ∼90% of the genome, are present at any given position in a very limited number of combinations. Moreover, we show that the distribution of the 12 marks along the genomic sequence defines four main chromatin states, which preferentially index active genes, repressed genes, silent repeat elements and intergenic regions. Given the compact nature of the Arabidopsis genome, these four indexing states typically translate into short chromatin domains interspersed with each other. This first combinatorial view of the Arabidopsis epigenome points to simple principles of organization as in metazoans and provides a framework for further studies of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms in plants.</field>

      <name>The H3K4-methyl epigenome regulates MLL leukemia stem cell oncogenic potential</name>
      <description>The genetic programs that maintain leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal and oncogenic potential have been well defined, however the epigenetic landscape that determines their cellular identity and functionality has not been established.  We report that LSCs in MLL-associated leukemia are maintained in an epigenetic state defined by relative genome-wide high-level H3K4me3 methylation and low level H3K79me2.  LSC differentiation is associated with dynamic reversal of these broad epigenetic profiles and concomitant down-regulation of the LSC maintenance transcriptional program.  LSCs also share with embryonic stem cells a large subset of genes with bivalent histone marks related to embryonic development.  The histone demethylase KDM5B negatively regulates MLL-induced leukemogenesis demonstrating the crucial role of the H3K4 global methylome for determining leukemia stem cell fate. Investigation of multiple histone modification marks and RNA Pol II in ckit+ and ckit- cells isolated and fractionated from MLL leukemia mice.</description>

      <name>Trans-acting regulatory variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</name>
      <description>Natural genetic variation can cause significant differences in gene expression, but little is known about the polymorphisms that affect gene regulation. We analyzed regulatory variation in a cross between laboratory and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Clustering and linkage analysis defined groups of coregulated genes and the loci involved in their regulation. Most expression differences mapped to trans-acting loci. Positional cloning and functional assays showed that polymorphisms in GPA1 and AMN1 affect expression of genes involved in pheromone response and daughter cell separation, respectively. We also asked whether particular classes of genes were more likely to contain trans-regulatory polymorphisms. Notably, transcription factors showed no enrichment, and trans-regulatory variation seems to be broadly dispersed across classes of genes with different molecular functions</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Natural genetic variation can cause significant differences in gene expression, but little is known about the polymorphisms that affect gene regulation. We analyzed regulatory variation in a cross between laboratory and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Clustering and linkage analysis defined groups of coregulated genes and the loci involved in their regulation. Most expression differences mapped to trans-acting loci. Positional cloning and functional assays showed that polymorphisms in GPA1 and AMN1 affect expression of genes involved in pheromone response and daughter cell separation, respectively. We also asked whether particular classes of genes were more likely to contain trans-regulatory polymorphisms. Notably, transcription factors showed no enrichment, and trans-regulatory variation seems to be broadly dispersed across classes of genes with different molecular functions.</field>

      <description>Dynamic changes in RNA and protein levels after exposure to 100µmol/L nimesulide and low-dose 0.5µmol/L cisplatin in oral cancer cells were screened to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell death. After 48 hours of treatment, SCC9 and SCC25 cells were analyzed for apoptosis and necrosis by FACS, immunohistochemistry and analysis of nucleotides by HPLC. Microarray GeneChips and the iTRAQ system were used to measure changes in the whole genome and proteome. FACS and immunohistochemical analyses showed an increased number of apoptotic and necrotic SCC9 and SCC25 cells after nimesulide and cisplatin exposure. Simultaneously, ATP and the energy charge of the SCC9 cells were significantly decreased. In SCC25 cells, ATP only significantly decreased after combined nimesulide/cisplatin exposure. In the SCC9 cell line, gene and proteome analysis detected and quantified one gene, keratin 6a and 540 proteins, respectively. After combined treatment, significant upregulation of histone H2A, H2B and H4 could be found with a local discovery false rate of 0.003 and 0.0027 for histone H2A and histone H2B, respectively. Using gene and proteome mapping, we could show that combined treatment of oral cancer cells with nimesulide and low-dose cisplatin induce necrosis and early apoptosis by the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Our results suggest potential clinical benefits of a nimesulide/cisplatin combination rather than single cisplatin treatment for oral cancer patients. Cell culture: A squamous carcinoma cell line of the tongue, SCC9, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Maryland, USA). The cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100U/mL penicillin and 100µg/mL streptomycin (all reagents from Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, Scotland) and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. SCC9 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and seeded at equal densities of 5x10^5 cells in 10cm tissue culture dishes. 24 hours later, cells were harvested using Trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley Scotland) and treated with 100µmol/L nimesulide, 0.5µmol/L cisplatin or a combination of nimesulide/cisplatin. Control dishes were treated in exactly the same way without the addition of the respective compound. The concentration of 100µmol/L for nimesulide was chosen as this concentration is in a pharmacologically relevant range for humans.  cDNA microarray, hybridization and image analysis: RNA isolation and preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the arrays were performed according to protocols of the manufacturer. Hybridization was done using three sets of human U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Ca, USA); only two nimesulide/cisplatin Samples are included in this submission. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Data normalization was performed using RMA.  The supplementary file 'GSE15308_sample_protocols.txt' contains detailed Sample protocols.</description>

        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = RMA-normalized signals
 Feature Extraction - The Affymetrix chips were normalized using RMA (robust multi-array analysis). For the acquisition of reliable data, we used triplicate arrays although duplicate arrays are usually recommended. In a filtering step, all probe sets with inter-quartile range &lt;0.3 were excluded, resulting in 300 probe sets for the analysis. A linear model for the comparison of the three treatment groups versus no treatment was calculated. However, due to the left-skewed distribution of the p-values (most likely induced by correlation between the probe sets), local false discovery rates were calculated for the three comparisons which give the probability of having no effect given the observed test statistics for each probe set. All probe sets with a local false discovery &lt;0.2 were considered as &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot;. A heatmap with a dendogram of the arrays was plotted. All pre-processing steps and analyses were performed using R.2.6 and the Bioconductor environment (www.Bioconductor.org).

      <name>Transcription profiling by array of yeast treated with clioquinol</name>
      <description>Clioquinol (CQ or iodochlorhydroxyquin, 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) is a hydrophobic chelator of copper, zinc, and iron. It was extensively used as an antibiotic for the treatment of diarrhea and skin infection in the mid-1900s, but then withdrawn because it was reported to be associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) in Japan. Interest in this drug was recently revived as it was shown that CQ specifically kills cancer cells and significantly decreases Abeta level. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of CQ drug effects and side effects are still unclear.  We used yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model to study how CQ affects molecular and cellular functions. Genechip analysis was utilized to examine the effect of CQ on gene expression at the genomic level. To study gene expression profiles of yeast treated with CQ, yeast cells were treated with CQ or DMSO for 5 hours and RNAs were extracted for microarray analysis.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Wild type BY4742 yeast strain grown in YPD to mid-log phase were inoculated 1:1 into fresh YPD supplemented with either DMSO (D) or CQ (Q) and grown at 30 degreeC at 175 rpm in a shaking incubator.
 Sample Processing - One percent (v/v) DMSO (D) or 80 uM CQ (Q) was supplemented into the yeast culture medium.
 Hybridization - Hybridization was performed according to standard Affymetrix procedures. Briefly, 10ug cRNA was hybridized for 16hr at 45 degreeC on Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 Arrays in an Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method (Collart, M. A., and Oliviero, S. (2001) Curr Protoc Mol Biol Chapter 13, Unit13 12).</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Clioquinol (CQ), a once popular antibiotic, was used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which this class of molecules works remains controversial. In this work, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to study how CQ affects molecular and cellular functions and particularly, copper, iron, and zinc homeostasis. We observed a CQ-induced inhibition of yeast growth, which could be slightly relieved by supplementation of copper or iron. Microarray results indicated that yeast cells treated with CQ sense a general deficiency in metals, despite elevated total cellular contents of copper and iron. Consistent with this, reduced activities of some metal-sensitive enzymes were observed. Intriguingly, CQ can increase the SOD1 activity, likely through Ccs1's accessibility to CQ-bound copper ions. Further studies revealed that CQ sequestrates copper and iron at the cellular membrane, likely the plasma membrane, resulting overall metal accumulation but cytosolic metal depletion. CQ's effects on metal-sensitive metalloenzymes were also verified in mammalian cell line SH-SY5Y. Together, our results revealed that CQ can regulate metal homeostasis by binding metal ions, resulting the cell sensing a state of deficiency of bioavailable metal ions while simultaneously increasing available metals to SOD1 (via Ccs1) and possibly some other metalloproteins that can access CQ-bound metals. We hope this regulation of metal homeostasis may be helpful in explaining the therapeutic effects of CQ used in disease treatment.</field>

      <name>Arctic charr exposed to acute thermal stress</name>
      <description>Arctic charr is an especially attractive aquaculture species given that it features the desirable tissue traits of other salmonids, but can be bred and grown at inland freshwater tank farms year round. It is therefore of interest to develop upper temperature tolerant (UTT) strains of Arctic charr to increase the robustness of the species in the face of climate change, as well as to enable production in more southern regions. We conducted an acute temperature trial to identify temperature tolerant and intolerant Arctic charr individuals. Specifically, approximately 200 fish were transferred to an experimental tank (diameter: 1.86 m, depth 50 cm) and left to acclimate for 48 h at ambient temperature. After acclimation, 10 fish were removed to act as a control group, then water that had been diverted through a heat exchanger was added to the flow-through system to increase the water temperature in the tank by 6°C/h until it reached 22°C, then 0.5°C every 30 min until the water reached 25°C, the observed lethal temperature for these fish. When the water temperature reached 25°C, the temperature was held constant and the fish were closely monitored for signs of stress. The first and last 10 individuals to show loss of balance were quickly removed from the tank for sampling, thus representing the 5% least and most temperature tolerant fish, respectively. A reference design microarray study was then performed with the cGRASP 32K microarray using six samples from each group (Intolerant, Tolerant, Control) to identify genes differentially expressed between groups. The results of this study will feed into an ongoing Arctic charr marker-assisted selection based broodstock development program, and may contribute to population-based conservation initiatives for salmonids in general. 18 microarray slides representing 6 individuals from 3 treatment groups (Intolerant, Tolerant and Control). One test cDNA labeled with cy5 and the common reference aRNA labeled with Cy3 was hybridized to each slide Reference design: 18 slides (6 x Tolerant fish, 6x Intolerant fish, 6x Control fish) were used.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Sample Processing - 200 Arctic charr were exposed to heat stress. 10 fish were sampled before the stress (control). Six randomly sampled fish in this group were used for microarray analysis.
 Hybridization - Details of the microarray hybridization process can be found at the University of Victoria cGRASP website (http://web.uvic.ca/grasp/microarray/array.html) within the .pdf document entitled Invitrogen Indirect cDNA Labeling System version 3.
 Labeling - cDNA (300 ng) and aRNA (500 ng) were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, using Invitrogen’s SuperScript Indirect cDNA Labeling System following the manufacturer's instructions.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated from gill tissues disrupted and homogenized in 1 ml TRIzol reagent using a Mixer-mill (Retch® MM 301) with tungsten carbide beads. Phase separation was conducted using 200 µl chloroform, and RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 ratios (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference&lt;br>Flags = P = present, A = absent, M = marginal&lt;br>PRE_VALUE = Lowess normalized ratios (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference
 Feature Extraction - All statistical analyses of the microarray data were conducted using Genespring ver. 7.3.1. Signals were normalized per spot and per chip using an intensity-dependent (LOWESS) normalization, then per gene to normalize to the median. Spots were filtered on flags present, and only spots with signals greater or equal to the average base/proportional value of the raw channel were retained.
 Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned at 74 and 72 PMT for Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and spot intensity was calculated with ImaGene ver. 6.5.1.</field>

      <description>Cancer cells express different sets of receptor type tyrosine kinases. These receptor kinases may be activated through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Fibroblasts may modify the biologic properties of surrounding cancer cells through paracrine mechansms. We used microarrays to obtain the global gene expression of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and various esophageal fibroblasts. A total of 22 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and fibroblasts were analyzed. 4 fibroblasts were obtained from surgically resected human esophagus. Cells were cultured under standard conditions, total  RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.</description>

      <name>Integrative analysis reveals extensive association between microRNA expression and mRNA-protein translation [miRNA]</name>
      <description>Transcription signatures have been used to stratify breast cancer patients into clinically distinct subgroups. However, transcription alone does not determine protein expression. Of potentially equal importance for determining the tumor phenotype is the rate at which transcripts are translated to form protein. Protein translation is controlled to a major degree by miRNA, and cancer cells may deregulate the expression of key genes by altering the activity of relevant miRNAs. The importance of miRNA deregulation and the extent to which multiple miRNAs coordinately deregulate key proteins in breast cancer is only partly understood. To gain such insight, we analyzed genome-wide miRNA expression and mRNA/protein expression for a panel of 105 selected cancer related genes in breast carcinomas from 283 patients. The miRNA-mRNA-protein interactome for the selected genes was constructed by modeling protein expression as a joint function of mRNA and miRNA expression, considering the effect of both one miRNA at a time, and all studied miRNAs simultaneously. The interactome represents a map of the global effects of miRNAs on protein expression, capturing direct as well as indirect effects. The results reveal extensive association between miRNA and protein expression as well as coordinated effects of multiple miRNAs on individual proteins. Applying the model onto two other independent primary breast cancer cohorts confirmed the generalizability of key aspects of the interactome map. The miRNA expression profiling of 283 breast cancer samples was performed using the 8x15k “Human miRNA Microarray Kit release 14.0 (V2)” with design id 029297 from Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In brief, 100 ng total RNA was dephosphorylated, labeled and hybridized for 20 hours, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Scanning was performed on Agilent Scanner G2565A, signals were extracted using Feature Extraction v10.7.3.1 and the subsequent data processing was performed using the GeneSpring software v11.0 (Agilent Technologies). In brief, the miRNA signal intensities were log2-transformed and normalized to the 90th percentile, and miRNAs that were detected in less than 10% of the samples were excluded. This resulted in 421 unique mature miRNAs. The Oslo Breast Cancer Consortium (OSBREAC)</description>

      <name>Gene Expression Profiling in Pachyonychia Congenita Skin</name>
      <description>Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a skin disorder resulting from mutations in keratin genes (KRT) 6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16, and KRT17 genes. One of the major symptoms is painful plantar keratoderma. The pathogenic sequelae resulting from the keratin mutations remain unclear.   To better understand PC pathogenesis.RNA profiling was performed on biopsies taken from PC-involved and uninvolved plantar skin of seven PC (-K6a, -K6b, -K16, -K17) patients as well as from control volunteers. Protein profiling was generated from tape-stripping samples.   A comparison of PC-involved skin biopsies to adjacent uninvolved plantar skin identified 112 differentially-expressed mRNAs common to patient groups harboring keratin protein (K) 6 and K16 mutations. Among these mRNAs, 25 encode structural proteins including keratins, small proline-rich and late cornified envelope proteins, 20 are related to metabolism and 16 encode proteases, peptidases, and their inhibitors including kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). mRNAs were also identified to be differentially expressed only in K6 (81) or K16 (141) patient samples. Furthermore, 13 mRNAs were identified that may be involved in pain including nociception and neuropathy. Protein profiling, comparing three K6a plantar tape-stripping samples to non-PC controls, showed changes in the PC corneocytes similar, but not identical, to the mRNA analysis.   Many differentially-expressed genes identified in PC-involved skin encode components critical for skin barrier homeostasis including keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, cornification, and desquamation. The profiling data provide a foundation for unraveling the pathogenesis of PC and identifying targets for developing effective PC therapeutics.

All buffers were pre-warmed to 25°C.
 Labeling - Total RNA (100 to 200 ng  of 50 ng/µl per sample) was processed following Agilent’s (Santa Clara, CA) Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol (Version 5.7)

Rosetta performs a two-sided, two-sample t-test on the means of the probe intensities corresponding to a single gene in each channel. The null hypothesis is that there is no fold change between the genes in the two channels.

      <name>DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana</name>
      <description>DNA methylation in wild type bolting plants, wild type seedlings, and ddm1 seedlings. The purpose of the McrBC methylation microarray assay is to determine which regions of a genome are methylated versus those that are unmethylated in a single Arabidopsis thanliana genotype. McrBC is a methylation-sensitive enzyme that restricts DNA only at purine-Cmethyl half sites when separated between 50bp and 3kb. A designated amount of DNA from a particular genotype is sheared to a size range of 1kb-10kb using nebulization. We restrict half of the nebulized DNA with McrBC, and the methylated fraction is then removed from the unmethylated fraction through gel purification of DNA fragments greater than 1kb.* The remaining nebulized DNA is subjected to the same gel purification scheme, but with no McrBC treatment. In a single hybridization, the untreated sample is labeled with Cy5 and the McrBC-treated sample with Cy3. Thus, after labeling and microarray hybridization, the ratio of normalized Cy5 to normalized Cy3 represents the relative methylation at the sequence represented by the spot on the microarray. Dye swap analysis is carried out to take account of experimental variation by repeating the hybridization with identical samples labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.  This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: GSE1329: DNA methylation in wild-type bolting Arabidopsis thaliana plants GSE1330: DNA methylation in ddm1 seedling Arabidopsis thaliana plants GSE1331: VC133+137, DNA methylation in ddm1 seedling Arabidopsis thaliana plants GSE1332: VC134+136, DNA methylation in wild-type seedling Arabidopsis thaliana plants Refer to individual Series</description>

      <name>Influence of dietary sucrose and copper content in a rat model of non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease</name>
      <description>Nutrigenomics analysis was used to investigate the molecular responses to dietary Cu deficiency independently and in combination with 30% (w/w) sucrose in a mature rat model of NAFLD. Low Cu significantly decreased hepatic and serum Cu, and induced NAFLD-like histopathology, mild steatosis, up-regulated transcripts in inflammation and hepatic stellate cell activation, and significantly increased oxidative stress. Rats fed low Cu together with 30% sucrose also developed insulin resistance, increased ATP citrate lyase and FASN expression, and greater oxidative stress. High sucrose with adequate Cu also promoted inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study indicates that low dietary Cu and sucrose consumption are singular and synergistic dietary factors in promotion of NAFLD and NASH that act independently of obesity or severe steatosis, likely by promoting oxidative stress and activation of inflammation and fibrosis. Mature (6 months old) male Wistar Rats that had been allowed ad libitum access to Mazuri rodent pellets were used in the study. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups and fed for 12 weeks with diets based on the Purified AIN76A formulation, modified for target sucrose and Cu content (Custom Animal Diets, Bangor, NJ). Sucrose and copper content in diets were as follows: ‘A’ CuD/30%- Cu deficient (&lt;0.3 mg Cu/kg)/30% sucrose, ‘B’ CuA/30%- Cu adequate (125 mg/kg)/30% sucrose, ‘C’ CuD/10%- &lt;0.3 mg/kg Cu/10% sucrose, and ‘D’ CuA (125 mg/kg Cu)/10% sucrose (control). Starch and dextrin were used to equalize carbohydrates.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Sample Treatment - The mouse hearts were harvested at 14 days after birth
 Hybridization - cDNAs were added to Affymetrix hybridization cocktails, heated at 99ºC for 2 min and hybridized for 16 h at 45ºC to GeneChips (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara CA). The microarrays were then washed at low (6X SSPE) and high (100mM MES, 0.1M NaCl) stringency and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence was amplified by adding biotinylated anti-streptavidin and an additional aliquot of streptavidin-phycoerythrin stain.
 Labeling - 100ng of total RNA was converted to first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase primed by a poly(T) oligomer that incorporated the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was followed by in vitro transcription (Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling Kit) for linear amplification and biotinylation of each transcript.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted using Rneasy mini kit (Qiagene)
 Scaning - A confocal scanner was used to collect fluorescence signal after excitation at 570 nm.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Microarray data were analyzed using the Oligo package available at the Bioconductor website (www.bioconductor.org). The raw data were first background-corrected by the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method and then normalized by an invariant set method. Probesets were considered expressed if at least one sample had a RMA expression value greater than the mean of the negative control probesets, 18,494 probesets were considered expressed.  Differential gene expression between the control and mutant mice was analyzed by the Limma package available at the Bioconductor website. P-values obtained from the multiple comparison tests were corrected by false discovery rates. Heatmap displays were created using the freely available MeV package ( http://www.tm4.org/mev/).

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - The seeds of the indicated genotype were surface steriled, planted on an MS plate, and grown at 23°C under long day (16h light, 8h dark) conditions for ten days before harvest.
 Sample Processing - No treatment applied.
 Library Construction - Nuclear lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei, and crosslinked histone-DNA complexes were isolated with antibody. DNA was purified after reverse crosslinking. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the single end DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). After adapter ligation, DNA was size-fractionated to obtain 300bp fragments from an agarose gel. The library was PCRed for 18 cycles and gel purified before sequencing.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Feature Extraction - The reads were aligned to the TAIR9 assembly using the ELAND extended program (Illumina) allowing up to two mismatches.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) has a key role in gene repression and developmental regulation. There is evidence that H3K27me3 is actively removed in plants, but it is not known how this occurs. Here we show that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), also known as Jumonji domain-containing protein 12 (JMJ12), specifically demethylates H3K27me3 and H3K27me2, whereas its metazoan counterparts, the KDM4 proteins, are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. Plants overexpressing REF6 resembled mutants defective in H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing. Genetic interaction tests indicated that REF6 acts downstream of H3K27me3 methyltransferases. Mutations in REF6 caused ectopic and increased H3K27me3 level and decreased mRNA expression of hundreds of genes involved in regulating developmental patterning and responses to various stimuli. Our work shows that plants and metazoans use conserved mechanisms to regulate H3K27me3 dynamics but use distinct subfamilies of enzymes.</field>

      <name>Global Transcriptome Analyses of Mammalian Terminal Erythroid Differentiation</name>
      <description>Purpose:The purpose of this study is to create unbiased, stage-specific transcriptomes by RNA-seq analyses of pure populations of both murine and human erythroblasts at distinct developmental stages. Methods: Recently developed FACS-based methods (Chen et al, PNAS, Liu et al, Blood, Hu et al Blood) were employed to purify morphologically and functionally discrete populations of cells, each representing specific stages of terminal erythroid differentiation. RNA was prepared from these cells and subjected to RNA-seq analyses. Results: There were vast temporal changes in gene expression across the differentiation stages, with each stage exhibiting unique transcriptomes.Clustering and network analyses revealed that differing stage-specific patterns of expression across differentiation were transcriptionally enriched for genes of differing function. Numerous differences were present between human and murine transcriptomes, with significant variation in the global patterns of gene expression. Conclusions: These data provide a significant resource for studies of normal and perturbed erythropoiesis, allowing a deeper understanding of mechanisms of erythroid development, differentiation, and inherited and acquired disease. Both murine and human erythroblasts at distinct developmental stage mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using IlluminaHiSeq 2000.</description>

We used these techniques to obtain pure populations of both human and murine erythroblasts at distinct developmental stages. RNA was prepared from these cells and subjected to RNA sequencing analyses, creating unbiased, stage-specific transcriptomes. Tight clustering of transcriptomes from differing stages, even between biologically different replicates, validated the utility of the FACS-based assays. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that there were marked differences between differentiation stages, with both shared and dissimilar gene expression profiles defining each stage within transcriptional space. There were vast temporal changes in gene expression across the differentiation stages, with each stage exhibiting unique transcriptomes. Clustering and network analyses revealed that varying stage-specific patterns of expression observed across differentiation were enriched for genes of differing function. Numerous differences were present between human and murine transcriptomes, with significant variation in the global patterns of gene expression. These data provide a significant resource for studies of normal and perturbed erythropoiesis, allowing a deeper understanding of mechanisms of erythroid development in various inherited and acquired erythroid disorders.</field>

      <name>DNA Methylation Changes in Allergic Patients Correlate with Symptom Severity  [gene expression]</name>
      <description>Altered DNA methylation patterns in CD4+ T-cells indicate the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in inflammatory diseases. However, the identification of these alterations is complicated by the heterogeneity of most inflammatory diseases. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is an optimal disease model for the study of DNA methylation because of its well-defined phenotype and etiology. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation (Npatients = 8, Ncontrols = 8) and gene expression (Npatients= 9, Ncontrols = 10) profiles of CD4+ T-cells from SAR patients and healthy controls using Illumina’s HumanMethylation450 and HT-12 microarrays, respectively. DNA methylation profiles clearly and robustly distinguished SAR patients from controls, during and outside the pollen season. Moreover, we found that this methylation signature correlated with symptom severity. In agreement with previously published studies, gene expression profiles of the same samples failed to separate patients and controls. Separation by methylation (Npatients = 12, Ncontrols = 12), but not by gene expression (Npatients = 21, Ncontrols = 21) was also observed in an in vitro model system in which purified PBMCs from patients and healthy controls were challenged with allergen. We observed changes in the proportions of memory T-cell populations between patients (Npatients = 35) and controls (Ncontrols= 9), which could explain the observed difference in DNA methylation. Our data highlight the potential of epigenomics in the stratification of immune disease and represents the first successful molecular classification of SAR using CD4+ T cells. Total RNA was isolated from CD4+ T-cells of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and healthy controls both during and outside the pollen season. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized to Illumina HT12 version 4 human whole-genome arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</description>

      <name>Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deleted for different subunits of the THO/TREX complex</name>
      <description>THO/TREX is a conserved nuclear complex that functions in mRNP biogenesis at the interface of transcription-RNA export with a key role in preventing transcription-associated genome instability. We used microarrays to analyze the impact of different THO/TREX mutations on gene expression and found that THO-Sub2 deletions have a high functional impact on highly expressed, long and G+C-rich genes regardless of gene function. S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPAD liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.</description>

        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = dchip signal intensity
 Feature Extraction - Microarray data analysis was performed using DNA-Chip Analyzer. PM probes, invariant set normalization, and model-based expression were used in this step. Outliers were treated as missing data. Genes showing at least 1.5-fold expression change compared to its isogenic wild-type strain were considered as altered (parameters: absolute difference between signal in mutant vs wild-type strain > 100; difference p-value > 0.05). Expression values obtenained using DNA-Chip Analyzer (www.dchip.org; Li &amp; Wong 2001).

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">THO/TREX is a conserved nuclear complex that functions in mRNP biogenesis and prevents transcription-associated recombination. Whether or not it has a ubiquitous role in the genome is unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip studies reveal that the Hpr1 component of THO and the Sub2 RNA-dependent ATPase have genome-wide distributions at active ORFs in yeast. In contrast to RNA polymerase II, evenly distributed from promoter to termination regions, THO and Sub2 are absent at promoters and distributed in a gradual 5' → 3' gradient. This is accompanied by a genome-wide impact of THO-Sub2 deletions on expression of highly expressed, long and high G+C-content genes. Importantly, ChIP-chips reveal an over-recruitment of Rrm3 in active genes in THO mutants that is reduced by RNaseH1 overexpression. Our work establishes a genome-wide function for THO-Sub2 in transcription elongation and mRNP biogenesis that function to prevent the accumulation of transcription-mediated replication obstacles, including R-loops.</field>

      <name>Transcriptional landscape of Rag2 -/- thymocytes [Mnase-Seq]</name>
      <description>We performed ChIP-Seq for hallmark TFs (Ets1, Runx1), histone modification marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3), total RNA Pol II, short RNA-Seq as well as nucleosome mapping mainly in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes. We also performed ChIP-Seq for E47 as well as nucleosome mapping, gene expression microarray analysis in CD4+ CD8+ DP thymocytes. Overall, we find a key role for the transcription factor Ets1, contributing towards alpha beta T cell lineage commitment via differential transactivation of stage-specific genes orchestrated by dynamic, co-association -mediated chromatin remodeling, as well as transcription dependent generation of a specialized chromatin structure at the TCR beta locus. Genome-wide analysis via ChIP-Seq for Ets1, Runx1, total RNA Pol II binding,  H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, short RNA-Seq, Mnase-Seq in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes, ChIP-Seq for E47, Mnase-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis in DP thymocytes  This Series represents Mnase-Seq data.</description>

        <field name="cell_type">primary Rag2 -/- thymocytes</field>
        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Thymuses were extracted from 5-6-week-old Rag2-/- knockout as well as C57BL/6 wild type mice and stored in RPMI medium. Cohorts of litter mates were used as biological replicates. To recover thymocytes, thymuses were subsequently passed twice through a 70µm Falcon cell strainer and stored in PBS. Cells were crosslinked 10 min in 10% formaldehyde followed by 5 min quenching in 250 mM glycine. DP cells were subsequently sorted via AutoMACS using, in turn, α-CD8-PE antibody conjugated to α-PE beads, and α-CD4 beads (Miltenyi). FACS profiles and cell purities were obtained for Rag2-/- and DP thymocytes via CD44-APC, CD25-FITC and CD8-PE, CD4-FITC staining, respectively
 Library Construction - Phenol-chroloform For MNase-Seq, 2x10e7 thymocytes were permeabilized in 50µl 150mM sucrose, 80mM KCl, 5mM K2HPO4, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM CaCl2, 35mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2% NP-40 for one minute at 37°C then treated with 10U MNase for 30 minutes at room temperature in 500µl 150mM sucrose, 50mM Tris pH8, 50mM NaCl, 2mM CaCl2. Digestions were stopped by adding 1.45ml lysis buffer for 10 minutes at 4°C. 200µl aliquots were subsequently treated with equal amounts of TE buffer and 0.2μg/ml RNAse A, 0.2µg/ml proteinase K for 2 hours each at 37°C and 55°C, respectively. DNA was purified via phenol-chloroform extraction and subsequently eluted in 50µl water using QiaQuick PCR purification columns. Following gel size-selection of mononucleosomal fragment sizes, libraries were been prepared according to the Life Technologies protocol, SOLiD ChIP-seq kit guide (A12066), using 15 PCR cycles. The quality of the libraries was checked with the Bioanalyser DNA High sensitivity. Sequencing was carried out on a SOLiD 4 sequencer at TAGC, Marseille, France.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - For the SOLiD 4 System, high-quality reads were matched to individual samples based on the barcode tag and using default parameters in SOLiD Experimental Tracking Software (SETS) v4.0.1. For SOLiD 5500xl, basecalls were performed using 5500 Series Genetic Analyzers Instrument Control Software v1.2. Alignment of reads to the mm9 genome was conducted using BFast 0.7.0 for SOLiD sequencing runs, according to manufacturers instructions. Only reads with a unique best scoring alignment were retained. Clonal artifacts were filtered out retaining the longer reads. Aligned reads were processed using a previously described in-house ChIP-Seq analysis pipeline (Koch, Fenouil et al 2011). Tags were then elongated to 146bp and converted to wig format using a binning window of 50bp. Replicate tracks were subsequently merged by addition. To account for differences in tag counts between DN and DP experiments, tag count normalization was performed by scaling DP datasets to DN tag counts. Visual inspection of invariant targets (e.g. Eβ for Ets1, β-actin for Pol II, H3K4me1/2, Mnase, the Hoxa locus for H3K27me3) allowed further fine tuning and scaling of DP tag-counts to reflect potential differences in signal to noise ratios between DN and DP experiments. Inverse peak detection was carried out with CoCAS using inversed data (with 0s replaced by 0.01) averaged into 50bp windows and converted to general feature format (GFF). Thresholds were 7.5 x SD + mean for the main window and 5 x SD + mean for the extension window. Artifacts were detected and removed by performing peak detection in CoCAS (using 2 X SD + mean and SD + mean as main and extension window thresholds, respectively) in reads originating from the Input treatment. Peaks were annotated to the nearest TSS, except in the case of intragenic peaks which were assigned to the surrounding gene. Peaks outside of [-5kb; +5kb] around known TSSs (refSeq, miRNA, rRNA, scRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and tRNA) were considered to be distal, while those falling within [-5kb; +5kb] around known TSSs were considered proximal. Distal peaks within a gene body were considered intragenic and those outside of gene bodies were considered intergenic. Genome_build: mm9 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Fragments were extended using an R pipeline described in Koch, Fenouil, Gut et al. 2011. Fixed-step 50bp wig files were generated using an R pipeline described in Koch, Fenouil, Gut et al. 2011. Peaks were called using CoCAS</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Primary monocytes were extracted from the blood samples of anonymous healthy male donors, donated by the luxembourgish Red Cross. The components of the blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells - PBMCs -, plasma and erythrocytes) were separated by Ficoll density gradient separation. After a 10 minute centrifugation (1000 g at room temperature without break), the PBMCs layer was collected and the CD14+ monocytes were isolated by using the MACS® technology (magnetic separation) from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Isolated CD14+ monocytes were plated at 4x106 cells per well in 6-well plates and differentiated for 11 days into macrophages using RPMI 1640 medium (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania) supplemented with 10% human serum, off the clot, type AB (A&amp;E Scientific, PAA, Pasching, Austria, lot number: C02108-1021), 0.1mg/mL streptomycin, 100U/mL penicillin and 0.1mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). During the differentiation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium on day 4 and day 7.
 Sample Treatment - For the experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 10μg/mL.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) is one of the highest induced genes in macrophages under pro-inflammatory conditions. Its function has been recently described: it codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1 induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and IFNγ, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic approach of both computational and experimental methods, we here shed more light on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels.</field>

 Feature Extraction - For the ChIP-chip data we performed a normalization step by an ANOVA model (Kerr et.al,2002) to remove technical biases.Let Yplfts be the log2 intensity of the probe s on the chip p and the array l, with treatment t and fluorochrome f.The considered model is: Yplfts=mu+ap+bl+abpl+cf+acpf+Eplfts, where ap+bl+abpl is the support effect (chip, array and interactions), cf is the fluorochrome effect, acpf  is the chip*fluorochrome interaction and the errors Eplfts are centered Gaussian variables.We estimated the parameters of the model and we removed quantified biases from the raw data.The IP and INPUT intensities for each biological replicate were then averaged on the dye-swap to remove gene-specific dye biases.To analyze data, we use ChIPmix, a method proposed by Martin-Magniette et al.(2008) that we have adapted to study several biological replicates simultaneously. The method investigates the relationship between IP and Input by a mixture model of regressions. For a probe, available observation are the two measurements IP and INPUT for the two biological replicates. These latter are assumed to be independent by definition. The (unknown) status of a probe is characterized through a label Z which is 1 if the probe is enriched and 0 if it is normal (not enriched).

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Post-translational modification of histones and DNA methylation are important components of chromatin-level control of genome activity in eukaryotes. However, principles governing the combinatorial association of chromatin marks along the genome remain poorly understood. Here, we have generated epigenomic maps for eight histone modifications (H3K4me2 and 3, H3K27me1 and 2, H3K36me3, H3K56ac, H4K20me1 and H2Bub) in the model plant Arabidopsis and we have combined these maps with others, produced under identical conditions, for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation. Integrative analysis indicates that these 12 chromatin marks, which collectively cover ∼90% of the genome, are present at any given position in a very limited number of combinations. Moreover, we show that the distribution of the 12 marks along the genomic sequence defines four main chromatin states, which preferentially index active genes, repressed genes, silent repeat elements and intergenic regions. Given the compact nature of the Arabidopsis genome, these four indexing states typically translate into short chromatin domains interspersed with each other. This first combinatorial view of the Arabidopsis epigenome points to simple principles of organization as in metazoans and provides a framework for further studies of chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms in plants.</field>

      <name>Expression data from the orthotopic tumors of MES-SA</name>
      <description>The spontaneous pulmonary metastasis model of human uterine sarcoma was established using GFP-expressed MES-SA cells. Several sublines with different metastatic potentials were generated by in vivo passaging. We used microarrays to identify the metastatic-related genes using the orthotopic tumors with different metastatic potentials. Orthotopic transplanted uterine sarcoma were observed after 3 weeks post-transplantation and the xenografted tumor reached about 2000 mm3 in additional 3 weeks. After 6 weeks post-transplantation, the animals were sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia, and the tumors were resected. The GFP-positive regions were collected using Leica MZ10F fluorescent stereomicroscope. This study compared the gene expression profiling between the orthotopic tumors with high (H)- and low (L)-metastatic potentials.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Anaplasma (formerly Ehrlichia) phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Neorickettsia (formerly Ehrlichia) sennetsu are intracellular vector-borne pathogens that cause human ehrlichiosis, an emerging infectious disease. We present the complete genome sequences of these organisms along with comparisons to other organisms in the Rickettsiales order. Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. display a unique large expansion of immunodominant outer membrane proteins facilitating antigenic variation. All Rickettsiales have a diminished ability to synthesize amino acids compared to their closest free-living relatives. Unlike members of the Rickettsiaceae family, these pathogenic Anaplasmataceae are capable of making all major vitamins, cofactors, and nucleotides, which could confer a beneficial role in the invertebrate vector or the vertebrate host. Further analysis identified proteins potentially involved in vacuole confinement of the Anaplasmataceae, a life cycle involving a hematophagous vector, vertebrate pathogenesis, human pathogenesis, and lack of transovarial transmission. These discoveries provide significant insights into the biology of these obligate intracellular pathogens.</field>

      <name>Molecular analysis of photic inhibition of blood-feeding in Anopheles gambiae</name>
      <description>Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes exhibit an endophilic, nocturnal blood feeding behavior. Despite the importance of light as a regulator of malaria transmission, our knowledge on the molecular interactions between environmental cues, the circadian oscillators and the host seeking and feeding systems of the Anopheles mosquitoes is limited. In the present study, we show that the blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes is under circadian control and can be modulated by light pulses, both in a clock dependent and in an independent manner. Short light pulses (~2-5 min) in the dark phase can inhibit the blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes momentarily in a clock independent manner, while longer durations of light stimulation (~1-2 h) can induce a phase advance in blood-feeding propensity in a clock dependent manner. The temporary feeding inhibition after short light pulses may reflect a masking effect of light, an unknown mechanism which is known to superimpose on the true circadian regulation. Nonetheless, the shorter light pulses resulted in the differential regulation of a variety of genes including those implicated in the circadian control, suggesting that light induced masking effects also involve clock components. Light pulses (both short and longer) also regulated genes implicated in feeding as well as different physiological processes like metabolism, transport, immunity and protease digestions. RNAi-mediated gene silencing assays of the light pulse regulated circadian factors timeless, cryptochrome and three takeout homologues significantly up-regulated the mosquito's blood-feeding propensity. In contrast, gene silencing of light pulse regulated olfactory factors down-regulated the mosquito's propensity to  Our study suggests that the mosquito’s feeding behavior is under circadian control. Long and short light pulses can induce inhibition of blood-feeding through circadian and unknown mechanisms, respectively, that involve chemosensory factors.  A series of assays were performed to assess transcriptomic changes in mosquitoes upon light stimulation and blood feeding in order to assess relationships between photic stimulation and modulation of feeding behavior.</description>

      <name>Genetic Loci that Regulate Ectopic Calcification in Response to Knee Trauma in LG/J by SM/J Advanced Intercross Mice</name>
      <description>Ectopic calcification in synovial tissues is devastating to diarthrodial joints. While some forms of synovial ectopic calcification have genetically simple basis, most cases manifest as complex traits with environmental and multigenic components. The location of causal loci or the physiological processes affected by allelic variants is poorly understood. Here, we report on genetic susceptibility to ectopic calcification in the LG/J and SM/J advanced intercross mice. Using 347 mice in 98 full-sibships, destabilization of medial meniscus was performed to induce joint injury. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to map calcification phenotypes to discrete genomic locations. To validate the functional significance of the selected QTL candidate genes, we compared mRNA expression between parental LG/J and SM/J inbred strains. Our findings showed that joint destabilization instigated ectopic calcifications as detected and quantified by micro-CT. Overall, we detected 20 QTLs affecting synovial and meniscus calcification phenotypes with 11 QTLs linked to synovial calcification. Functional and bioinformatic analyses of single nucleotide polymorphism identified functional classifications relevant to angiogenesis (Myo1e, Kif26b, Nprl3, Stab2, Fam105b), bone metabolism/calcification (Tle3, Tgfb2, Lipc, Nfe2l1, Ank, Fam105b), arthritis (Stab2, Tbx21, Map4k4, Hoxb9, Larp6, Col1a2, Adam10, Timp3, Nfe2l1, Trpm3), and ankylosing-spondylitis (Ank, Pon1, Il1r2, Tbkbp1) indicating that ectopic calcification involves multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, the expression of 11 candidate genes was significantly different between LG/J and SM/J. Correlation analysis showed that Aff3, Fam81a, Syn3, and Ank were correlated with synovial calcification. Our findings of multiple genetic loci affecting the phenotype suggest the involvement of multiple genes contributing to its pathogenesis. We collected tissue lysates from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from mouse knee joints and analyzed the expression of several genes by Affymetrix QuantiGene Plex assay.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Knee joint sections were taken from mice which underwent full-thicknees articular cartilage repair at 8 weeks old. They were raised on normal diet and standard procedures.
 Sample Treatment - Samples were from mice with different genetic background with varying degree of healing capacity.
 Hybridization - The quantification of mRNAs using the Affymetrix QuantiGene 2.0 Plex Assay kit. An appropriate volume of working bead mix was prepared scaled for 96-well plate format: 18.5 uL nuclease-free water, 33.3 uL lysis mixture, 2 uL blocking reagent, 0.2 uL proteinase K, 1 uL capture beads and 5 uL probe set. The working bead mix was vortexed for 10 sec and 60 uL of it was dispensed into each well of the hybridization plate followed by addition of 40 uL of tissue homogenate to each well. The plate was sealed using a pressure seal and placed on an inverted plate lid placed onto the VorTemp 56 shaking incubator and incubated for 18-22 h at 54oC at 600 rpm. Post-incubation, the contents of the hybridization plate were transferred to a magnetic separation plate after centrifugation at 240X g for 60 sec and mixing the contents a few times with a pipette. The magnetic separation plate was inserted into the hand-held magnetic plate washer and washed the plate three times using 100 uL of wash buffer per well. Then 100 uL of pre-amplifier working reagent (36 uL of 2.0 pre-amplifier in 12 mL of amplifier diluent) was dispensed into each well of the magnetic separation plate, sealed and incubated at 50C for 1 h while shaking at 600 rpm. After incubation, the plate was washed as above and 100 uL of amplifier working reagent per well and again incubated at 50C for 60 min at 600 rpm. Then the plate was washed again and 100 uL of label probe working reagent was added to each well and the sealed plate was placed into VorTemp and incubated at 50C for 60 min at 600 shaking rpm. After 60 min, the washing procedure was repeated as above, 100 uL of SAPE working reagent was pipetted into each well. The plate was foiled, removed from plate washer and placed on a shaking platform at room temperature with shaking at 800 rpm for 60 sec followed by shaking at 600 rpm for 30 min. The plate was washed with 130 uL of SAPE wash buffer in each assay well, sealed the plate, removed from plate washer, wrapped in aluminum foil and allowed to shake at 800 rpm for 3 min at room temperature.

      <name>Leukemia stem cell-enriched population expresses self-renewal gene-expression signature [RNA-Seq]</name>
      <description>Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling intermediates, the leukemia stem cell compartment was preferentially sensitive to RAS withdrawal. Use of RAS-pathway inhibitors showed that NRASG12V maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies. Primary leukemia cells harvested from spleens were sorted into immunophenotypic subpopulations (Mac-1High, Mac-1LowKit–Sca-1–, Mac-1LowKit+Sca-1–, and Mac-1LowKit+Sca-1+). RNA was extracted from this subpopulations of cells and submitted for RNA sequencing.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the specific functions of these pathways in AML are unclear, thwarting the rational application of targeted therapeutics. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we used a murine model that harbors Mll-AF9 and a tetracycline-repressible, activated NRAS (NRAS(G12V)). Using computational approaches to explore our gene-expression data sets, we found that NRAS(G12V) enforced the leukemia self-renewal gene-expression signature and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9- and Myb-dependent leukemia self-renewal gene-expression program. NRAS(G12V) was required for leukemia self-renewal independent of its effects on growth and survival. Analysis of the gene-expression patterns of leukemic subpopulations revealed that the NRAS(G12V)-mediated leukemia self-renewal signature is preferentially expressed in the leukemia stem cell-enriched subpopulation. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling, Mac-1(Low) cells, which harbor leukemia stem cells, were preferentially sensitive to NRAS(G12V) withdrawal. NRAS(G12V) maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies. Together, these experimental results define a RAS oncogene-driven function that is critical for leukemia maintenance and represents a novel mechanism of oncogene addiction.</field>

      <name>Global regulation of mRNA translation and stability in the early Drosophila embryo by the Smaug RNA-binding protein- Polysome gradient/microarray study</name>
      <description>To gain a panoramic view of Smaug function in the early embryo we identified mRNAs that are bound to Smaug using RNA co-immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to DNA microarrays. We also identified the mRNAs that are translationally repressed by Smaug using polysome gradients and microarrays. Comparison of the bound mRNAs to those that are translationally repressed by Smaug and those that require Smaug for their degradation suggests that a large fraction of Smaug?s target mRNAs are both translationally repressed and degraded by Smaug. Smaug directly regulates components of the TRiC/CCT chaperonin, the proteasome regulatory particle and lipid droplets as well as many metabolic enzymes, including several glycolytic enzymes. Embryos laid by wild-type or smaug1 homozygous mothers were collected 0-2 hours post-egglaying and lysed in an equal volume of polysome lysis buffer. The lysate was applied to polysome gradients that were fractionated into four fractions. mRNA was extracted from each fraction and converted to cDNA that was applied on custom-designed Nimblegen arrays. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the four fraction in  each of the two genotypes. To demonstrate that the presence of mRNAs at the bottom of the gradient were the result of translation, we performed a puromycin experiment. smaug1 homozygous mothers were collected 0-2 hours post-egglaying and lysed in an equal volume of puromycin lysis buffer and then treated either with cycloheximide or puromycin. The lysate from each condition was applied to separate polysome gradients that were each fractionated into four fractions. mRNA was extracted from each fraction and converted to cDNA that was applied on custom-designed Nimblegen arrays. Two biological replicates were performed for each of the four fraction from each of the two conditions.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Embryos and flies were raised at 25 degrees
 Hybridization - RNA was hybridized using the protocol described in the NimbleGen Array User’s Guide (Gene Expression Arrays, version 5.0)
 Labeling - RNA samples from polysome experiments were used to generate double stranded cDNA following the protocol described in the NimbleGen Array Users Guide (Gene Expression Arrays, version 5.0) using a primer mixture of random hexamer primers and anchored-oligo-dT primers and with the following change: all reagents were added at half of the volume and amount indicated in the user guide. Either Cy3 or Cy5-tagged random nonamers (as indicated for each sample) were used to label cDNAs using the Roche NimbleGen protocol.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Embryos laid by wild-type or smaug1 homozygous mothers were collected 0-2 hours post-egglaying, dechorionated with 100% bleach and lysed in an equal volume of polysome lysis buffer (7.5 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 25mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mg/mL heparin, 0.5 mg/mL cycloheximide, 1 mM DTT, 50 U/mL RNasin, 1mM AEBSF, 2 ug/mL leupeptide, 2 mM benzamidine, 2 ug/mL pepstatin A). Lysed samples were diluted 1 in 12.5 in polysome lysis buffer and 30% triton was added to a final concentration of 1% and then spun at 6000xg for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatant was diluted in polysome lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton to an A260 of 12.5. A 12 mL 15% to 45% linear sucrose gradient in 7.5 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 was created using a BioComp Model 117 Gradient Mate gradient maker using a rotation angle of 80.5 degrees and a rotation speed of 18 rpm for 1 minute and 58 seconds. After chilling the polysome gradient on ice, 400 uL of diluted embryo extract was loaded onto the top of the gradient which was then spun at 36,000 rpm in a SW 41 Ti rotor for 2.5 hours. The gradients were then separated into four pools (pool 1 contained the top 4 mL, pool 2 contained the next 2 mL, pool 3 contained the next 3 mL and pool 4 contained the last 3 mL and the pellet). In vitro transcribed Arabidopsis spike-in RNAs was then added to each fraction to be used in subsequent data normalization. 20% SDS, 0.5 M EDTA and 20 mg/mL proteinase K were added to each fraction to final concentrations of 0.8%, 0.01M and 0.128mg/mL, respectively and then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Glycogen was then added to a final concentration of 80 ug/mL and samples were ethanol precipitated overnight and the resulting pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in phenol saturated water. Following two phenol-chloroform extractions samples were precipitated by the addition of 7.5M LiCl to a final concentration of 1.5M and an overnight incubation at 4oC. The resulting pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, resuspended in water and ethanol precipitated in the presence of 80 ug/mL of glycogen and 0.3 M sodium acetate. The precipitate was then washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in water. Experiments that investigated changes in mRNA mobility due to puromycin included those samples starting in P (indicating addition of puromycin) and C (indicating cycloheximide addition negative control). In these experiments, smaug1 embryos were lysed in puromycin lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5,2mM MgCl2, 500 mM KCl, 100uM GTP, 1mM DTT, 50U/ml RNasin, 1mM AEBSF, 2ug/mL leupeptide, 2mM benzamidine, 2ug/mL pepstatin A). The lysed samples were split in half and cycloheximide was added to one sample to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and puromycin was added to the other sample to a final concentration of 2mM. Samples were left on ice for 20 minutes and then incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. Both samples were then diluted 1 in 12.5 with polysome lysis buffer supplemented with either puromycin or cycloheximide and 30% triton was added to a final concentration of 1%. The samples were then spun at 6000xg for 10 minutes and the supernatant was diluted with polysome lysis buffer supplemented with either puromycin or cycloheximide to give an A260 of 12.5 and these diluted samples were then fractionated and microarrays were performed as described above. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.
 Scaning - Microarrays were scanned using Genepix Pro software on a Molecular Devices GenePix 4000B or 4300A scanner and quantified using Nimblescan.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Polysome microarrays were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) quantile method. We further normalized the data using Arabidopsis spike-in RNAs (see extract protocol).  The hybridization signals from the spike-in RNAs were utilized by appllying a linear transformation to each sample with the parameters, a and b, determined by fitting the linear function Y = aX+b using the spike-in signal, where X is the expression level of the spike-in RNAs in a specific sample, and Y is the mean expression level of the spike-in RNAs across all the samples. The genes significantly expressed in wild-type or smaug mutant embryos in each of pools 1, 2, 3 and 4 were separately determined using one class unpaired analysis in SAM (FDR&lt;5%). We defined the genes significantly expressed in the wild-type and smaug mutant embryos as the union of the significantly expressed genes from the four fractions derived from that genotype. We then compared these two lists and defined their intersection as the list of genes significantly expressed in both wild-type and smaug mutant embryos, and restricted all the following analysis to the genes in this list. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 expression values calculated by Nimblescan and follow-up normalization describe in data processing</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling by array of Rattus norvegicus proximal tibial growth plates at different ages</name>
      <description>To explore the mechanisms responsible for spatial and temporal regulation of the growth plate, we microdissected postnatal rat growth plates into their constituent zones and then used microarray analysis to characterize the changes in gene expression that occur as chondrocytes undergo spatially-associated differentiation and temporally-associated senescence. Microdissection was used to collect individual growth plate zones from proximal tibiae of 1-wk rats and the proliferative and early hypertrophic zones of growth plates from 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-wk rats and gene expression was analyzed using microarray.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Rats (not 1wk animals) were castrated at the age of 18 days.
 Sample Processing - Proximal tibiae were excised, trimmed of cortical bone, embedded in OCT, and stored at -80C. 60um frozen sections were fixed, stained and dehydrated before being manually microdissected into individual growth plate zones under a xylene droplet using scalpel blades and hypodermic needles (Nilsson et al J Endocrinol 2007;193:75-84).
 Hybridization - 15 ug of fragmented cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.
 Labeling - 50-100ng of total RNA was amplified and labeled using the Two-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents (Affymetrix, P/N 900494) according to Expression Analysis Technical Manual, version 701021 Rev.5 (Affymetrix)
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted from microdissected cartilage by guanidinium thiocyanate, proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, isopropanol precipitation, LiCl-precipitation as previously described except that one tenth of every volume was used (Heinrichs C et al. Endocrinology 1994;135:1113-8).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = RMA signal Intensity

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Growth plates are spatially polarized and structured into three histologically and functionally distinct layers-the resting zone (RZ), proliferative zone (PZ), and hypertrophic zone (HZ). With age, growth plates undergo functional and structural senescent changes including declines of growth rate, proliferation rate, growth plate height and cell number. To explore the mechanisms responsible for spatially-associated differentiation and temporally-associated senescence of growth plate in an unbiased manner, we used microdissection to collect individual growth plate zones from proximal tibiae of 1-week rats and the PZ and early hypertrophic zones of growth plates from 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-week rats and analyzed gene expression using microarray. We then used bioinformatic approaches to identify significant changes in biological functions, molecular pathways, transcription factors and also to identify specific gene products that can be used as molecular markers for individual zones or for temporal development.</field>

      <name>The DEAD box helicase RDE-12 promotes amplification of RNAi in cytoplasmic foci in C. elegans</name>
      <description>RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent mechanism for down-regulating gene expression. Conserved RNAi pathway components are found in animals, plants, fungi and other eukaryotes. In C. elegans, the RNAi response is greatly amplified by the synthesis of abundant secondary siRNAs. Exogenous double stranded RNA is processed by Dicer and RDE-1/Argonaute into primary siRNA that guides target mRNA recognition.  The RDE-10/RDE-11 complex and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RRF-1 then engage the target mRNA for secondary siRNA synthesis.  However, the molecular link between primary siRNA production and secondary siRNA synthesis remains largely unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if the sub-cellular sites for target mRNA recognition and degradation coincide with sites where siRNA synthesis and amplification occur. In the C. elegans germline, cytoplasmic P granules at the nuclear pores and perinuclear Mutator foci contribute to target mRNA surveillance and siRNA amplification, respectively. We report that RDE-12, a conserved FG domain containing DEAD-box helicase, localizes in P-granules and cytoplasmic foci that are enriched in RSD-6 but are excluded from the Mutator foci. Our results suggest that RDE-12 promotes secondary siRNA synthesis by orchestrating the recruitment of RDE-10 and RRF-1 to primary siRNA targeted mRNA in distinct cytoplasmic compartments.

After 50 hrs at 20oC, ~50000 worms were washed 5 times with 10ml M9, and then homogenized in Tri-reagent. Samples were kept at -80oC.
 Library Construction - Purified total RNA were processed with MirVana kit (Invitrogen) for small RNA enrichment. Equal amount of small RNAs (30~40ug) were resolved on 15% TBE-Urea Acrylamide gels. Gels containing small RNAs of 20-26nt were cut out and purified with a small-RNA PAGE Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, R1070). Each small RNA sample was treated with TAP and processed with the ScriptMiner Small RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre, SMMP1012). Libraries from different samples were indexed with RNA-Seq Barcode Primers (Epicentre, RSBC10948). Two biological samples of each condition (wild type +sel-1 RNAi, rde-12+sel-1 RNAi, wild type+OP50 and rde-12+OP50) were used for library preparation</field>

      <name>Maternal siRNAs as regulators of parental genome imbalance and gene expression in endosperm of Arabidopsis seeds.</name>
      <description>Seed size is important to crop domestication and natural selection and is affected by the balance of maternal and paternal genomes in endosperm. Endosperm, like placenta in mammals, provides reserves to the developing embryo. Interploidy crosses disrupt the genome balance in endosperm and alter seed size. Specifically, paternal-excess crosses (2 × 4) delay endosperm cellularization (EC) and produce larger seeds, whereas maternal-excess crosses (4 × 2) promote precocious EC and produce smaller seeds. The mechanisms for responding to the parental genome dosage imbalance and for gene expression changes in endosperm are unknown. In plants, RNA polymerase IV (PolIV or p4) encoded by NRPD1a is required for biogenesis of a major class of 24-nt small interfering RNAs (also known as p4-siRNAs), which are predominately expressed in developing endosperm. Here we show that p4-siRNA accumulation depends on the maternal genome dosage, and maternal p4-siRNAs target transposable elements (TEs) and TE-associated genes (TAGs) in seeds. The p4-siRNAs correlate negatively with expression levels of AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) genes in endosperm of interploidy crosses. Moreover, disruption of maternal NRPD1a expression is associated with p4-siRNA reduction and AGL up-regulation in endosperm of reciprocal crosses. This is unique genetic evidence for maternal siRNAs in response to parental genome imbalance and in control of transposons and gene expression during endosperm development. 8 samples: 2x X 2x seed,leaf; 4x X 4x seed,leaf; 2x X 4x seed,leaf; 4x X 2x seed,leaf.</description>

 Sample Processing - Reciprocal interploidy crosses were made by pollinating diploid flowers with tetraploid pollens (2x4) or tetraploid flowers with diploid pollens (4x2) 24h after manual emasculation. Diploid and tetraploid flowers were manually self-pollinated to serve as balanced dosage controls. Seeds were dissected from the siliques at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days after pollination (DAP) to eliminate maternal tissue contamination. Small RNA library construction and gene expression assays were performed using the seeds dissected at 6DAP.
 Library Construction - Total RNA was extracted from seeds and leaves using Plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% urea-polyacrylamide gel. The small RNA fraction (18-30-nt) was recovered from the gel. The small RNAs were ligated to 5’ and 3’ RNA oligo adapters (Supplementary Table x3) and reverse-transcribed to produce first strand cDNAs, which were amplified by PCR and sequenced by Illumina Genome Analyzer II (at UC Davis Genome Center).</field>

 Feature Extraction - Short reads (40-nt) were parsed to remove 3’ adaptors and mapped to Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR9) using CASHX (http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/db/download.html). To reduce ambiguity, only the perfectly matched reads were used for further analysis. The sequences from chloroplast and mitochondrial and structural non-coding RNAs including ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs were excluded from the analysis.</field>

This is unique genetic evidence for maternal siRNAs in response to parental genome imbalance and in control of transposons and gene expression during endosperm development.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of rice varieties Nipponbare and 6-4 grown in either phosphorus deficient or fertilized soil</name>
      <description>Nipponbare performs poorly in phosphorus (P) deficient soil whereas a Nipponbare-derived NIL containing the Pup1 allele of donor parent Kasalath is tolerant to P deficiency. In this experiment we compared gene expression patterns in roots of this NIL to Nipponbare, grown either in a P deficient or P fertilized soil. The aim is to separate constitutive differences in expression from those induced by P deficiency. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extrancted from root that were grown under two conditions and prepared three biological replicant in each line (total 6 samples in each line).  Experiment Overall Design: We used 6 slides for this experiment, in each slide, Nipponbare and 6-4 samples grown under same condition were hybridized.</description>

      <name>Identification of Multiple Proteins Coupling Transcriptional Regulation to Genome Stability in Arabidopsis thaliana</name>
      <description>Eukaryotic genomes are heavily regulated by epigenetic marks that often act to modulate the transcriptional control of genetic elements. In Arabidopsis thaliana the ATXR5 and ATXR6 histone methyltransferases, and their cognate H3K27 monomethylation mark, act in transcriptional silencing while also maintaining genome stability by preventing generation of excess DNA corresponding to pericentromeric heterochromatin. In this study we characterize the atxr5 atxr6 transcriptome and its relationship to the DNA damage response which suggests that the atxr5 atxr6 transcriptional defects may be epistatic to the genome instability defects in the mutants. In addition we isolate several factors that modulate both the transcriptional and genomic instability phenotypes of atxr5 atxr6 mutants, which suggest a mechanism for atxr5 atxr6-induced extra DNA involving conflicts between the replicative and transcriptional processes in the cell. PolyA RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole-genome resequencing (DNA-seq), and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (methyl-seq) was performed on Arabidospsis thaliana mutant and wildtype plants.  DNA-seq was used to characterize DNA copy number and map EMS-induced mutations, RNA-seq was used to quantify transcript abundance and map EMS-induced mutations, and methyl-seq was used to assess DNA methylation. Details of the relationship between samples in this series and figures in the associated manuscript can be found in Supplemental Table 4 of the associated manuscript. Unless otherwise noted in the description all lines are ecotype Columbia, and all genotypes should be assumed homozygous unless otherwise indicated with a '/'.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - For growth on glucose as sole carbon source, the cells were precultured in nutrient medium. After the cells were washed in minimal medium, they were suspended in minimal medium containing glucose.
 Hybridization - The Cy3 or Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Dried Cy3 or Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were resuspended in hybridization buffer containing 30% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The Cy3 or Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were mixed together and hybridized to a microarray slide (Shigella flexneri 2a str. 2457T plus Shigella flexneri 2a str. 301 virulence plasmid pCP301 Oligonucleotide 3x15K microarray) (Mycroarray.com, Ann Arbor, MI). After overnight at 42C, the slide was washed twice with washing solution 1 containing 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 42C, and once with washing solution 2 containing 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, and finally four times with 0.1X SSC for 1 min at room temperature. The slide was dried by centrifugation at 650 rpm for 5min.
 Labeling - cDNA probes for cDNA microarray analysis were prepared by the reverse-transcription of total RNA (25ug) in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP and 6ug of random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 hrs. The cDNA probes were cleaned up using Microcon YM-30 column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and then followed by coupling of Cy3 dye (for reference) or Cy5 dye (for test sample) (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - The integrity of bacterial total RNA was checked by capillary electrophoresis with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and further purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen, Valencia, CA).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = normalized fold change (linear scale) (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference
 Feature Extraction - Hybridization image was analyzed by GenePix Pro 3.0 software (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA) to obtain gene expression ratios (reference vs test sample). Microarray data analysis was carried out by Genowiz 4.0TM (Ocimum Biosolutions, India). Global lowess was used for data analysis with normalization.
 Image Adquisition - Hybridization image on the slide was scanned by Axon 4000B (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA).</field>

      <name>Next Generation Deep Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of microRNA affected by thapsigargin treatment</name>
      <description>Purpose: microRNA profiles were generated from NIH-3T3 cells control and thapsigargin treated, in duplicate. The goal of this study was to compare microRNA profiles of untreated and thapsigargin treated NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. Methods: NIH-3T3 cells were grown to confluency and either untreated or treated with 500 nM thapsigargin in media for 24 hours. Cells were harvested with TriZol and RNA isolated according to manufacturers protocol Analysis Outline: Short reads in fastq format were assembled using BclToFastq.pl script from Illumina CASAVA 1.8.1 software pipeline.Read quality was examined using FastQC program (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Adapters were trimmed at the 3'end using Btrim prgram (PMID:21651976), only sequences equal to and longer than 18nt were retained, leading N base was trimmed at the 5' end. Unique reads were collapsed using Raw_data_parse program from miRExpress suite (PMID:19821977) (the result of this process is a file that contains unique sequences in one column and number of times this sequence was found in the library in another). They can be found in *.merge files in trimmed_reads directory. Collapsed reads were reformatted and uploaded into miRanalyzer web-based pipeline (http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/miRanalyzer/miRanalyzer.php; PMID:21515631) and matched to known mature miRNA (miRBase vesion 16), RFAM database (version 15) of known non-coding RNAs and known gene transcripts. The purpose of miRAnalyzer analysis was to only detect known miRNAs, prediction of novel miRNAs was not performed; search parameters were kept at default. MiRanalyzer output is saved in miRanalyzer folder with detailed information about mapping to known miRNA. Known miRNAs were divided into mature, maturestar (star sequences), maturestarunobs (star sequences not in miRBase) and hairpin. For each of the libraries there are files with unique and ambiguous mappings. Differentional expression analysis was based on unique alignments to known miRNAs (mature_unique.txt file in miRanalyzer folder). Mature_unique.txt has following columns: name: mature miRNA ID from miRBase; #unique reads: number of unique reads mapped; readCount: number of reads mapped; norm_expressed_all: normalized to all reads; norm_expressed_mapped: normalized to mapped reads. miRNA expression profiling was performed using edgeR bioconductor package (PMID:20478825). For differential expression analysis, used TMM normalization and analysis using common disperion (using tagwise dispersion yielded the same results). FDR was calculated according to Hochberg-Benjamini procedure (PMID:2218183). Results of differential expression analysis were saved in diff_exp folder as diff_exp.txt. diff_exp.txt contains miRNA concentrations in log scale, log2 ratio of WT to KO; p-values and FDR corrected p-values. miRNAs were sorted by p-value.

MiRanalyzer uses bowtie short read aligner to match short sequences against the genome, known mature miRNA sequences, star miRNA sequences, miRNA generating hairpins, star sequences, which are not in miRBase and, finally, the library of other non-coding RNAs (RFAM). Corresponding sequences were uploaded from miRanalyzer website (http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/miRanalyzer/standalone.html). Finally, miRanalyzer performs prediction of novel miRNAs. Read counts of uniquely mapped miRNAs were loaded into R; differentially expressed miRNAs were detected using DESeq v. 1.4.1 following the instructions provided in user manual.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Organ transplant recipients face life-long immunosuppression and consequently are at high risk of comorbidities. Occasionally, kidney transplant recipients develop a state of targeted immune quiescence (operational tolerance) against an HLA-mismatched graft, allowing them to withdraw all immunosuppression and retain stable graft function while resuming immune responses to third-party antigens. Methods to better understand and monitor this state of alloimmune quiescence by transcriptional profiling may reveal a gene signature that identifies patients for whom immunosuppression could be titrated to reduce patient and graft morbidities. Therefore, we investigated 571 unique peripheral blood samples from 348 HLA-mismatched renal transplant recipients and 101 nontransplant controls in a four-stage study including microarray, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry analyses. We report a refined and highly validated (area under the curve, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 0.97) peripheral blood three-gene assay (KLF6, BNC2, CYP1B1) to detect the state of operational tolerance by quantitative PCR. The frequency of predicted alloimmune quiescence in stable renal transplant patients receiving long-term immunosuppression (n=150) was 7.3% by the three-gene assay. Targeted cell sorting of peripheral blood from operationally tolerant patients showed a significant shift in the ratio of circulating monocyte-derived dendritic cells with significantly different expression of the genes constituting the three-gene assay. Our results suggest that incorporation of patient screening by specific cellular and gene expression assays may support the safety of drug minimization trials and protocols.</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Sufficient quantity of genomic DNA can be a bottleneck in genome-wide analysis of clinical tissue samples. DNA polymerase Phi29 can be used for the random-primed amplification of whole genomes, although the amplification may introduce bias in gene dosage. We have performed a detailed investigation of this technique in archival fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tumor DNA by using cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Phi29 amplified DNA from matched pairs of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tumor samples with similar efficiency. The distortion in gene dosage representation in the amplified DNA was nonrandom and reproducibly involved distinct genomic loci. Regional amplification efficiency was significantly linked to regional GC content of the template genome. The biased gene representation in amplified tumor DNA could be effectively normalized by using amplified reference DNA. Our data suggest that genome-wide gene dosage alterations in clinical tumor samples can be reliably assessed from a few hundred tumor cells. Therefore, this amplification method should lend itself to high-throughput genetic analyses of limited sources of tumor, such as fine-needle biopsies, laser-microdissected tissue, and small paraffin-embedded specimens.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Cells were grown in BHI (brain heart infusion). aerobic growth; with shaking (300rpm) at 37 (degree_C)
 Sample Processing - ON-cultures were diluted 50x and grown in BHI to OD600 ~0.2, split in two, centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in ½ volume of fresh BHI. Then, ½ volume of BHI (control) and ½ volume of BHI containing bovine bile were added to the two cultures, respectively. The final concentration of bovine bile was 1%. The two cultures were then further incubated, and 10-mL samples were collected immediately after addition of the stress agent(s) (t0), and after 10 (t10), 20 (t20), 30 (t30), 60 (t60) and 120 (t120)min. aerobic growth; with shaking (300rpm) at 37 (degree_C); 6.5 % NaCl; 10-mL culture
 Hybridization - Purified samples were then dried, before the dried samples were resuspended in 140 ?L hybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.1 % (wt/vol) SDS, 1.0 % (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin, 50 % (vol/vol) formamide and 0.01 % (wt/vol) single-stranded salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for 16h at 42 &amp;deg;C to the E. faecalis oligonucleotide array in a Tecan HS 400 pro hybridization station (Tecan). Arrays were washed twice at 42 &amp;deg;C with 2 x SSC + 0.2 % SDS, and twice at 23 &amp;deg;C with 2 x SSC, followed by more stringent washes at 23 &amp;deg;C with 0.2 x SSC and with filtrated H20. Two replicate hybridizations were conducted for each test strain. The Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (PerkinElmer) were swapped in one of the two replicate hybridizations. hyb temp (42 degree_C); hyb volume (135 uL)
 Labeling - RNA was labeled with the FairPlay Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's protocol, with the following modifications: for each labelling reaction, 10&amp;#956;g of random hexamers (Amersham) and 10&amp;#956;g of total RNA was initially preheated at 70 (degree_C) for 10 min. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR mix (5x SuperScript III reaction buffer, 20x dNTP mix, 0,1M dithiothreitol, 20 U RNase block and 520 U SuperScript III) was added to the annealed primers and RNA, and the reaction further incubated for 3h at 46 (degree_C). After labelling, unincorporated dyes were removed from the samples using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated by means of FastPrep (BIO101/Savent) as follows: The frozen cell pellets were thawed and 350&amp;#956;L lysis buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen), supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol) beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), was added to each cell suspension. The suspensions were transferred to tubes containing 0.6g acid-washed, RNase-free glass beads (&lt; 106microns) (Sigma) and 250&amp;#956;L chloroform (Merck). Cells were lysed by shaking the tubes for 20s at speed 6 in a FastPrep bead-beater (BIO101/Savent). The tubes were centrifuged for 2min at 13000 rpm (Biofuge Pico, Heraeus), and supernatants transferred to eppendorf tubes. Pellets were resuspended in 350&amp;#956;L beta-mercaptoethanol-containing lysis buffer RLT, and the cell suspensions transferred back to the tubes with the glass beads for a second extraction, to increase the overall RNA yield. 250&amp;#956;L ethanol was added to the supernatant fluids from the two extractions, and after mixing, each sample was applied to an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen). The columns were further washed and RNA eluted according to the RNeasy Mini kit protocol (Qiagen), with "on column"-DNA digestions with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The robust physiology of Enterococcus faecalis facilitates tolerance to various stresses. We here report the transcriptional response of E. faecalis V583 to growth in the presence of 6.5% NaCl. Among the early responses observed was an immediate down-regulation of mscL, accompanied by an up-regulation of genes predicted to be involved in uptake of extracellular potassium and glycine betaine. The high NaCl concentration also induced expression of chaperons and cell envelope related traits, such as the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (epa) locus. Functional genetic analysis revealed reduced salt stress resistance in both epaB and epaE mutants. The reduced salt resistance phenotype associated with the epaB mutant was restored by complementation, hence demonstrating a role of Epa in the physiological robustness of E. faecalis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Epa confers increased resistance towards multiple cell envelope stress-inducing factors. Accordingly, these findings delineate a potential link between the robust nature of E. faecalis and its ability to perform as a human pathogen, and provide a new perspective on the mechanisms by which Epa contributes to virulence. Notably, the high NaCl concentration also resulted in strict repression of the gelE-sprE operon and impaired gelatinase activity.

      <name>Effects of EVI1 mild expression in HeLa cells</name>
      <description>We studied the variations of mRNA amounts after Flag-EVI1 or Flag expression in HeLa cells. Despites EVI1 discovery in 1988, its recognized role as a dominant oncogene in myeloid leukemia and more recently in epithelial cancers, only a few target genes were known and it was not clear why EVI1 was involved in cancer progression. Here we obtained the genomic binding occupancy and expression data for EVI1 in human cells. We identified numerous EVI1 target cancer genes and genes controlling cell migration and adhesion. Moreover, we characterized a transcriptional cooperation between AP1 and EVI1 that regulated proliferation and adhesion through a feed-forward loop. Furthermore, this study provides human genome-wide mapping and downstream analyses for EVI1 that will be useful for the research community. 8 samples were collected. Each condition was done in 4 replicates, collected 24 hours after transfection (for mild expression of EVI1). Transfections with Flag-expressing vector were used as controls.</description>

      <description>The leaf transcriptome of the Arabidopsis thaliana aquaporin gene PIP1;2 T-DNA insertion line was compared to that of control plants. In total 730 genes were found to be differentially regulated. This regulation pattern was compared to mild drought stress and low CO2 Affymetrix data to elucidate whether loss of the aquaporin resembles transcriptomic changes of drought stress or lack of CO2 supply. Mild drought stress data were obtained from Harb A, Krishnan A, Ambavaram MMR, Pereira A (2010) Molecular and Physiological Analysis of Drought Stress in Arabidopsis Reveals Early Responses Leading to Acclimation in Plant Growth. Plant Physiology 154: 1254-1271 (GSE24177). Low CO2 data were obtained from Oliver E.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - plants were grown on soil under standard greenhouse conditions with a 12-h photoperiod (24°C day/20°C night), 60% relative humidity, a photon flux density at plant level of about 70 to 80 µmol m-2 s-1 and at an ambient CO2 concentration of 370 µmol mol-1
 Library Construction - Total RNA was isolated from leaf samples of 10 individual plants (3 weeks old) using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden Germany) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Subsequently, 3’ UTR cDNA libraries were constructed by GATC–Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Libraries were sequenced using the Genome Analyzer II. After quality control, raw reads were obtained from GATC–Biotech (Konstanz, Germany).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Sequencing reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis TAIR9 reference genome using BLAT (Kent, 2002). The resulting mapping file was parsed using an in-house pearl script kindly provided by A. Weber, Düsseldorf, Germany (Brautigam et al., 2008). This procedure ensured that only the mapping hit with the best match to the corresponding read was retained. Differentially expressed genes were identified by applying a Poisson statistics and a Bonferroni correction (Audic and Claverie, 1997).

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (htt) protein. To uncover candidate therapeutic targets and networks involved in pathogenesis, we integrated gene expression profiling and functional genetic screening to identify genes critical for mutant htt toxicity in yeast. Using mRNA profiling, we have identified genes differentially expressed in wild-type yeast in response to mutant htt toxicity as well as in three toxicity suppressor strains: bna4Δ, mbf1Δ, and ume1Δ. BNA4 encodes the yeast homolog of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, a promising drug target for HD. Intriguingly, despite playing diverse cellular roles, these three suppressors share common differentially expressed genes involved in stress response, translation elongation, and mitochondrial transport. We then systematically tested the ability of the differentially expressed genes to suppress mutant htt toxicity when overexpressed and have thereby identified 12 novel suppressors, including genes that play a role in stress response, Golgi to endosome transport, and rRNA processing. Integrating the mRNA profiling data and the genetic screening data, we have generated a robust network that shows enrichment in genes involved in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Strikingly, these observations implicate dysfunction of translation in the pathology of HD. Recent work has shown that regulation of translation is critical for life span extension in Drosophila and that manipulation of this process is protective in Parkinson disease models. In total, these observations suggest that pharmacological manipulation of translation may have therapeutic value in HD.</field>

      <description>Prostate Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) are considered one of the main reasons the tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here we employed a chemoresistant xenograft prostate cancer model in NOD/SCID mice and found CD54 is a reliable new marker for prostate CSCs. Gene expression profile were utilized to analyze stemness-related genes in cancer stem cells. 12 Male NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). For xenograft generation, 1×106 LNCaP cells were subcutaneously injected into the backs of NOD/SCID mice (n=24). When tumors reached a diameter of 5 mm after 3 d, mice were randomly divided into two groups without castration (12 per group). Mice in the treatment group were administered with cisplatin at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 3 d for 30 d. Mice in the control group were treated with vehicle PBS. Tumors were taken out for microarray assay after 30 d.</description>

      <name>Saturated fat stimulates obesity and hepatic steatosis and affects gut microbiota composition by an enhanced overflow of dietary fat to the distal intestine</name>
      <description>We studied the effect of dietary fat type, varying in polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio's (P/S) on development of metabolic syndrome. C57Bl/6J mice were fed purified high-fat diets (45E% fat) containing palm oil (HF-PO; P/S 0.4), olive oil (HF-OO; P/S 1.1) or safflower oil (HF-SO; P/S 7.8) for 8 weeks. A low-fat palm oil diet (LF-PO; 10E% fat) was used as a reference. Additionally, we analyzed diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition and mucosal gene expression. The HF-PO diet induced a higher body weight gain and liver triglyceride content compared to the HF-OO, HF-SO or LF-PO diet. In the intestine, the HF-PO diet reduced microbial diversity and increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Although this fits a typical obesity profile, our data clearly indicate that an overflow of the HF-PO diet to the distal intestine, rather than obesity itself, is the main trigger for these gut microbiota changes. A HF-PO diet-induced elevation of lipid metabolism-related genes in the distal small intestine confirmed the overflow of palm oil to the distal intestine. Some of these lipid metabolism-related genes were previously already associated with the metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, our data indicate that saturated fat (HF-PO) has a more stimulatory effect on weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation than unsaturated fat (HF-OO and HF-SO). The overflow of fat to the distal intestine on the HF-PO diet induced changes in gut microbiota composition and mucosal gene expression. We speculate that both are directly or indirectly contributive to the saturated fat-induced development of obesity and hepatic steatosis.   Keywords: Diet intervention study Nine-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LF-PO) and three different types of high-fat diet, based on palm oil (HF-PO; P/S1.0), olive oil (HF-OO; P/S4.6) and safflower oil (HF-SO; P/S10.1) for 8 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly and after 7 weeks of diet intervention an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. After 2 weeks of diet intervention, 6 mice per high-fat diet group were anaesthetized with a mixture of isofluorane (1.5%), nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%) and the small intestines were excised. Adhering fat and pancreatic tissue were carefully removed. The small intestines were divided in three equal parts along the proximal to distal axis (SI 1, SI 2 and SI 3) and microarray analysis was performed on mucosal scrapings.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands) and were housed in the light- and temperature-controlled animal facility of Wageningen University. They had free access to water and prior to the diet intervention they received standard laboratory chow.
 Sample Processing - Nine-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LF-PO) and three different types of high-fat diet, based on palm oil (HF-PO; P/S1.0), olive oil (HF-OO; P/S4.6) and safflower oil (HF-SO; P/S10.1) for 8 weeks.
 Hybridization - Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (described in the eukaryotic section in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual Rev. 3 from Affymetrix).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated RNA was further column-purified using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). RNA concentration was measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Isogen, Maarssen, The Netherlands) and analyzed on a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) with 6000 Nano Chips according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each part of small intestine, total RNA was pooled per diet group (n=6).</field>

      <name>Domains of genomewide gene expression dysregulation in Down syndrome [ChIP-seq]</name>
      <description>Trisomy 21 (T21) is the most frequent genetic cause of cognitive impairment. To assess the perturbations of gene expression in T21, and to eliminate the noise of the genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either up- or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins’ fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS and wild-type, also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina-associated (LADs) and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall LADs position was not altered in trisomic cells. However, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results suggest that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some T21 phenotypes. H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq profiling of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21.</description>

      <name>A Leukemic Stem Cell Expression Signature is Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</name>
      <description>Context: In many cancers, specific subpopulations of cells appear to be uniquely capable of initiating and maintaining tumors. The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immune-deficient mice indicating that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is organized as a cellular hierarchy driven by self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical significance remains unclear. Objective: To measure associations between a leukemic stem cell expression signature and clinical outcomes in AML. Design, Setting, and Patients: We defined a gene expression signature of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML patient samples and xenografts, based on a functional definition in transplantation assays. Using previously published gene expression data of bulk AML from four independent cohorts totaling 1047 patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study, defining an LSC score and evaluating it for associations with known predictors of risk including cytogenetic subtype and molecular mutations, and as an independent prognostic factor. Main Outcome Measures: Reproducible associations between a leukemic stem cell signature and overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival. Results: The LSC score was similar across most AML subtypes, but was lower in promyelocytic leukemia, and prognostically favorable cases harboring NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. Strikingly, high scores associated with inferior overall (OS), event-free (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) in these independent cohorts, whether considering patients with a normal karyotype [hazard ratio (HR) range for OS 1.13-1.18, p&lt;0.012 in all cases], or those with cytogenetic anomalies (HR range for OS 1.07-1.15, p&lt;0.01 in all cases). In multivariate analysis, the LSC score was associated with poor outcomes independently of age, FLT3 or NPM1 mutations, and cytogenetic risk group, and added to their prognostic value. Conclusions: High expression of a leukemic stem cell gene expression signature is independently associated with adverse outcomes in AML Cellular fractionation and expression profiling of normal and leukemic subsets:  Human samples were obtained at the Stanford University Medical Center  according to an approved protocol of the Institutional Review Board after informed consent.  Normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells were purchased from AllCells Inc. (Emeryville, CA) and human cord blood was obtained from Stanford University. For AML specimens, peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was obtained, and gene expression microarray data were generated using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays from the following populations purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting: AML LSC (Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90-, n=7), AML LPC (Lin-CD34+CD38+, n=7), AML Blasts (Lin-CD34-), normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC, Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA-; bone marrow and cord blood, n=7), multipotent progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA-; bone marrow and cord blood, n=7), common myeloid progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123+CD45RA-; bone marrow, n=4), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123+CD45RA+; bone marrow, n=4), and megakaryocyte-erthythrocyte progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+CD123-CD45RA-; bone marrow, n=4). Raw data were deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, accession GSE24006). Detailed methods for purification of cellular subsets and clinical features of the corresponding AML patients have been reported previously. Microarray analysis and definition of LSC signature:   Fourteen paired LSC and LPC samples from 7 patients described above were combined with 16 paired samples (8 LSC and 8 LPC) from an independent study to produce one dataset for analysis. Individual genes differentially expressed between paired LSC and LPC were identified using Significance Analysis of Microarrays, employing a paired metric (false discovery rate&lt;10%). The ‘LSC signature’ in a given dataset was defined as the first principal component of these genes (the linear weighted sum of gene expression values that summarizes the maximum possible proportion of their total variance) across samples from that dataset. The LSC signature was evaluated across all purified subpopulations described above. To identify biological themes distinguishing LSC from LPC, all genes on microarrays were ranked by their geometric mean difference in expression between paired LSC/LPC samples, and evaluated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Raw microarray data were obtained as Affymetrix CEL files for four publicly available bulk AML gene expression studies from NCBI GEO (GSE12417, n=163 normal-karyotype AML only, with OS outcomes; GSE10358, n=184, OS and EFS; GSE14468, n=527, OS, EFS and RFS) and the National Cancer Institute caArray database (accession willm-00119, n=170 non-FAB M3, OS only). Matrices of re-analyzed data linked below as supplementary files.  Ingenuity Pathways Analysis was used to identify interaction networks of genes.</description>

      <name>Gene expression patterns in IgG4-RD before and after steroid treatment and healthy control groups</name>
      <description>Transcriptome analysis in patients with IgG4-RD and healthy controls IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a new emerging disease entity characterized by elevated serum IgG4 concentrations and tissue tumefaction or infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells. At present, however, it is not clear whether IgG4-RD is caused by abnormalities in acquired immunity, like autoimmune diseases, or whether the excess production of IgG4 is a true cause of IgG4-RD or an epiphenomenon associated with inflammatory and/or allergic reactions. We therefore attempted to identify genes related to the pathogenesis or clinicopathology of IgG4-RD. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with IgG4-RD before and after steroid therapy and from healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted and DNA microarray analysis was performed to screen for genes showing changes in expression. To exclude any gender-related differences in gene expression, DNA microarray analysis was performed only on samples obtained from male patients and controls. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Ambion® WT Expression kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), labeled with GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling and Controls kits (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and hybridized to GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix), which include 28869 probes. Digitalized image data were processed using GeneChip® Operating Software (Affymetrix).</description>

      <name>De novo assembly of the desert tree Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) based on RNA-Seq data provides insight into drought response, gene discovery and marker identification</name>
      <description>Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the gene expression profiling for drought treated and control plants by using  NGS. Methods: The four RNA samples were pooled to one, using equivalent quantities of each sample for transctiptome sequencing. Meanwhile, the four RNA samples were used to construct the library for DGE sequencing. Results: Using Illumina sequencing technology, we generated over two billion bases of high-quality sequence data on H. ammodendron and conducted de novo assembly and annotation of genes without prior genome information. These reads were assembled into 79,918 unigenes (mean length=728 bp).In addition, DGE reads were mapped to the assembled transcriptome for gene expression analysis under drought stress. In total, 1,060 differentially expressed genes were identified. H. ammodendron seedlings grew for one month, and then one set of seedlings were treated with a one-week (7d) stress, and the second set of seedlings was used as a control and received no treatment. Each treatment was with two replicates.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - H. ammodendron seeds were provided by the Gansu Desert Control Institute. The seeds were sowed on damp filter papers and incubated at 4℃ for 4 days before being placed at 23℃ under long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) conditions with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 150μmol m-2 s-1. The seedlings were grown in four pots (20 seedlings/pot) representing two replicates of two treatments.
 Sample Treatment - After the seedlings grew for one month, one set of seedlings were treated with a one-week (7d) stress, and the second set of seedlings was used as a control and received no treatment. The control pots were irrigated from the bottom every day, while drought-stressed pots were not irrigated and were monitored for wilting symptoms.
 Library Construction - Several tissues, including leaves, stems and roots, were then harvested from the drought and control samples for subsequent RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted from the two replicates of the drought and control plants with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, 15596-026) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols</field>

      <name>HNF4α is a therapeutic target that links AMPK to WNT signaling in early-stage gastric cancer</name>
      <description>Background Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and the most common cancer in East Asia. Development of targeted therapies for this disease has focused on a few known oncogenes but has had limited effects. Objective To determine oncogenic mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets specific for gastric cancer by identifying commonly dys-regulated genes from the tumors of both Asian-Pacific and Caucasian patients. Design We generated transcriptomic profiles of 22 Caucasian gastric cancer tumors and their matched non-cancerous samples, and performed an integrative analysis across different gastric cancer gene expression datasets. We examined the inhibition of commonly overexpressed oncogenes and their constituent signaling pathways by RNAi and/or pharmacologic inhibition. Results We found that HNF4α upregulation was a key signaling event in gastric tumors from both Caucasian and Asian patients, and HNF4α antagonism was antineoplastic. Perturbation experiments in GC tumor cell lines and xenograft models further demonstrated that HNF4α is downregulated by AMPKα signaling and the AMPK agonist metformin; blockade of HNF4α activity resulted in cyclin downregulation, cell cycle arrest, and tumor growth inhibition. HNF4α also regulated WNT signaling through its target gene WNT5A, a potential prognostic marker of diffuse type gastric tumors. Conclusions Our results indicate that HNF4α is a targetable oncoprotein in gastric cancer, is regulated by AMPK signaling through AMPKα, and resides upstream of WNT signaling. HNF4α may regulate “metabolic switch” characteristic of a general malignant phenotype and its target WNT5A has potential prognostic values. The AMPKα-HNF4α-WNT5A signaling cascade represents a potentially targetable pathway for drug development. Integrative analysis of Caucasian and Asian-Pacific gastric tumor expression datasets (including newly generated transcriptomic profiling of 22 tumors in this study) revealed a relatively small common sets of highly overexpressed genes.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Cell were grown and maintained in a 37 degreeC incubator with 5% CO2.
 Sample Processing - 5x10^6 MM1.S cells lentivirally infected with control shRNA or beta-catenin shRNA vectors and sorted for GFP positive populations were cultured in triplicate, washed in PBS and then resuspended in Trizol reagent (invitrogen).
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol, purified using RNeasy kit (Qiagen)</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100. Data were further process by the PLIER method.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells with complex molecular characteristics that evolves from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a highly prevalent premalignant condition. MM is the second most frequent hematologic cancer in the United States, and it remains incurable, thereby highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches, particularly those targeting common molecular pathways involved in disease progression and maintenance, shared across different MM subtypes. Here we report that Wnt/beta-catenin is one such pathway. We document the involvement of beta-catenin in cell-cycle regulation, proliferation, and invasion contributing to enhanced proliferative and metastatic properties of MM. The pleiotropic effects of beta-catenin in MM correlate with its transcriptional function, and we demonstrate regulation of a novel target gene, Aurora kinase A, implicating beta-catenin in G2/M regulation. beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A are present in most MM but not in normal plasma cells and are expressed in a pattern that parallels progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM. Our data provide evidence for a novel functional link between beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A, underscoring a critical role of these pathways in MM disease progression.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Labeling -  THE INSTITUTE FOR GENOMIC RESEARCH Standard Operating Procedure TITLE: AMINOALLYL LABELING OF RNA FOR MICROARRAYS SOP #:  M004 REVISION LEVEL:  2 EFFECTIVE DATE: 3/4/02  AUTHOR: Jeremy Hasseman  PRIMARY REVIEWERS: Emily Chen, Ivana Yang   1. PURPOSE    This protocol describes the labeling of eukaryotic RNA with aminoallyl labeled  nucleotides via first strand cDNA synthesis followed by a coupling of the  aminoallyl groups to either Cyanine 3 or 5 (Cy 3/Cy5) fluorescent molecules.  2. SCOPE  This procedural format is utilized by Human Colon Cancer and Mouse microarray  projects under the supervision of John Quackenbush within the Eukaryotic  Genomics Dept.  3. MATERIALS  3.1 5-(3-aminoallyl)-2^deoxyuridine-5^-triphosphate (AA-dUTP) (Sigma; Cat  # A0410) 3.2 100 mM dNTP Set PCR grade (Life Technologies; Cat # 10297-018) 3.3 Random Hexamer primers (3mg/mL) (Life Technologies; Cat # 48190- 011) 3.4 SuperScript II RT (200U/?L) (Life Technologies; Cat # 18064-014) 3.5 Cy-3 ester (AmershamPharmacia; Cat # PA23001) 3.6 Cy-5 ester (AmershamPharmacia; Cat # PA25001) 3.7 QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen; Cat # 28106) 3.8 RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen; Cat # 74106)  3.9 Microcon YM-30 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore; Cat # 42410)  4. REAGENT PREPARATION  4.1 Phosphate Buffers  4.1.1 Prepare 2 solutions: 1M K2HPO4 and 1M KH2PO4  4.1.2 To make a 1M Phosphate buffer (KPO4, pH 8.5-8.7) combine:  1M K2HPO4 ..9.5 mL 1M KH2PO4 ..0.5 mL   4.1.3 For 100 mL Phosphate wash buffer (5 mM KPO4, pH 8.0, 80%  EtOH) mix:   1 M  KPO4 pH 8.5...  0.5 mL  MilliQ water ... 15.25 mL  95% ethanol ... 84.25 mL  Note:  Wash buffer will be slightly cloudy.  4.1.4 Phosphate elution buffer is made by diluting 1 M KPO4, pH 8.5 to  4 mM with MilliQ water.  4.2 Aminoallyl dUTP   4.2.1 For a final concentration of 100mM add 19.1 µL of 0.1 M KPO4  buffer (pH 7.5) to a stock vial containing 1 mg of aa-dUTP.  Gently  vortex to mix and transfer the aa-dUTP solution into a new  microfuge tube.  Store at -20oC.  4.2.2 Measure the concentration of the aa-dUTP solution by diluting an  aliquot 1:5000 in 0.1 M KPO4 (pH 7.5) and measuring the OD289.   (Stock concentration in mM = OD289 x 704)  4.3 Labeling Mix (50X) with 2:3 aa-dUTP: dTTP ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           4.3.1 Mix the following reagents:                Final concentration dATP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dCTP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dGTP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dTTP (100 mM) 3µL... (15 mM) aa-dUTP (100 mM) 2µL... (10 mM)     Total: 20µL  4.3.1 Store unused solution at -20oC.  4.4 Sodium Carbonate Buffer (Na2CO3):  1M, pH 9.0  4.4.1 Dissolve 10.8 g Na2CO3 in 80 mL of MilliQ water and adjust pH to  9.0 with 12 N HCl; bring volume up to 100 mL with MilliQ water.  4.4.2 To make a 0.1 M solution for the dye coupling reaction dilute 1:10  with water.  Note:   Carbonate buffer changes composition over time; make it fresh  every couple of weeks to a month.  4.5  Cy-dye esters   4.5.1 Cy3-ester and Cy5-ester are provided as a dried product in 5 tubes.   Resuspend a tube of dye ester in 73 ?L of DMSO before use.  4.5.2 Wrap all reaction tubes with foil and keep covered as much as  possible in order to prevent photobleaching of the dyes.   Note: Dye esters must either be used immediately or aliquotted and  stored at -80oC.  Any introduced water to the dye esters will result  in a lower coupling efficiency due to the hydrolysis of the dye  esters.  Since DMSO is hygroscopic (absorbs water from the  atmosphere) store it well sealed in desiccant.    5. PROCEDURE  5.1 Aminoallyl Labeling  5.1.1 To 10 ?g of total RNA (or 2 ?g poly(A+) RNA) which has been  DNase I-treated and Qiagen RNeasy purified, add 2 ?L Random  Hexamer primers (3mg/mL) and bring the final volume up to 18.5  ?L with RNase-free water.  5.1.2 Mix well and incubate at 70oC for 10 minutes.  5.1.3 Snap-freeze in dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 seconds, centrifuge  briefly at >10,000 rpm and continue at room temperature.  5.1.4 Add:  5X First Strand buffer .. 6 ?L 0.1 M  DTT  .. 3 ?L 50X aminoallyl-dNTP mix .. 0.6 ?L SuperScript II RT (200U/?L) .. 2 ?L 5.1.5 Mix and incubate at 42oC for 3 hours to overnight.  5.1.6 To hydrolyze RNA, add:   1 M  NaOH    10 ?L  0.5 M  EDTA   10 ?L   mix and incubate at 65oC for 15 minutes.  5.1.7 Add 10 ?L of 1 M HCl to neutralize pH.  (Alternatively, one can  add 25 ?L 1 M HEPES pH 7.0 or 25 ?L 1 M Tris pH 7.4)   5.2 Reaction Purification I:  Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free  amines (use either the Qiagen or the Microcon method)   Qiagen Cleanup Method:  Note: This purification protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick  PCR purification kit protocol.  The phosphate wash and elution  buffers (prepared in 4.1.3 and 4.1.4) are substituted for the Qiagen  supplied buffers because the Qiagen buffers contain free amines  which compete with the Cy dye coupling reaction.  5.2.1 Mix cDNA reaction with 300 ?L (5X reaction volume) buffer PB  (Qiagen supplied) and transfer to QIAquick column.  5.2.2 Place the column in a 2 ml collection tube (Qiagen supplied) and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.2.3 To wash, add 750 ?L phosphate wash buffer to the column and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.4 Empty the collection tube and repeat the wash and centrifugation  step (5.2.3).   5.2.5 Empty the collection tube and centrifuge column an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.  5.2.6 Transfer column to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L phosphate elution buffer (see 4.1.4) to the center of the  column membrane.  5.2.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.2.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.2.6-  5.2.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  5.2.10 Dry sample in a speed vac.  or~ Microcon YM-30 Cleanup Method:  5.2.1 Place the Microcon sample reservoir into a collection microfuge  tube.  Add 375 ?L of water to the cDNA reaction tube and then  pipette the sample into the Microcon sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube without touching the membrane.  5.2.2 Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 min.   Note: Never centrifuge column to dryness as this will decrease product  recovery.  Adjust spin time to allow for optimal filtration while  allowing enough solution to remain for sufficient recovery.  5.2.3 Empty collection microfuge tube.  5.2.4 To wash add 450 ?L of water to the sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 minutes.    5.2.5 Empty collection microfuge tube and repeat previous wash step.  5.2.6 Invert Microcon sample reservoir into a new collection microfuge  tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute to collect purified  sample.  5.2.7 Dry the sample in a speed vac.    5.3 Coupling aa-cDNA to Cy Dye Ester.  5.3.1 Resuspend aminoallyl-labeled cDNA in 4.5 ?L 0.1 M sodium  carbonate buffer (Na2CO3), pH 9.0.  Note: Carbonate buffer changes composition over time so make sure you  make it fresh every couple of weeks to a month.  5.3.2 Add 4.5 ?L of the appropriate NHS-ester Cy dye (prepared in  DMSO: see 4.5)  Note: To prevent photobleaching of the Cy dyes wrap all reaction tubes  in foil and keep them sequestered from light as much as possible.   5.3.3 Incubate the reaction for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.  5.4 Reaction Purification II:  Removal of uncoupled dye (Qiagen PCR  Purification Kit)  5.4.1 To the reaction add 35 ?L 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2.  5.4.2 Add 250 ?L (5X reaction volume) Buffer PB (Qiagen supplied).  5.4.3 Place a QIAquick spin column in a 2 mL collection tube (Qiagen  supplied), apply the sample to the column, and centrifuge at  ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.4.4 To wash, add 0.75 mL Buffer PE (Qiagen supplied) to the column  and centrifuge at ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Note: Make sure Buffer PE has added ethanol before using (see label for  correct volume).  5.4.5 Empty collection tube and centrifuge column for an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.   5.4.6 Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L Buffer EB (Qiagen supplied) to the center of the column  membrane.  5.4.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.4.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.4.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.4.6-  5.4.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  Note: This protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick Spin  Handbook (04/2000, pg. 18).  5.5 Analysis of Labeling Reaction  5.5.1 Use a 50 ?L Beckman quartz MicroCuvette to analyze the entire  undiluted sample in a spectrophotometer.  5.5.2 Wash the cuvette with water and blow dry with compressed air  duster.  5.5.3 Pipette sample into cuvette and place cuvette in spectrophotometer.  5.5.4 For each sample measure absorbance at 260 nm and either 550 nm  for Cy3 or 650 nm for Cy5, as appropriate.  5.5.5 Pipette sample from cuvette back into the original sample tube.  5.5.6 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of cDNA synthesized  using:   pmol nucleotides = [OD260 * volume (uL) * 37 ng/?L * 1000 pg/ng]      324.5 pg/pmol  Note: 1 OD260 = 37 ng/?L for cDNA; 324.5 pg/pmol average molecular  weight of a dNTP) 5.5.7 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of dye incorporation  (Cy3 or Cy5 accordingly) using:  pmol Cy3  = OD550 * volume (?L)    0.15  pmol Cy5 = OD650 * volume (?L)    0.25  nucleotides/dye ratio =     pmol cDNA                  pmol Cy dye  Note:   >200 pmol of dye incorporation per sample and a ratio of less than  50 nucleotides/dye molecules is optimal for hybridizations (see  Microarray Cookbook II)   5.5.8 After analysis mix together the two differentially labeled probes  (Cy3 vs. Cy5) which will be hybridized to the same microarray  slide.  5.5.9 Dry the Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture to completion in a speed vac and  continue with SOP: M005 for the hybridization of the probe to a  microarray slide.  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction -  Animal handling and RNA preparation at the Medical College of Wisconsin.  I. Animal handling at Medical College of Wisconsin  == Forty-eight rats are used per study, with eight groups of six rats each. 6 Female parental normoxic 6 Male parental normoxic 6 Female parental hypoxic 6 Male parental hypoxic 6 Female consomic normoxic 6 Male consomic normoxic 6 Female consomic hypoxic 6 Male consomic hypoxic == Each group of six rats is divided into two pools of three animals each, with each pool containing tissues from 3 rats. Pool A Pool B == Four individual tissues from all three animals are pooled together. Heart Kidney Liver Lung pool pool pool pool 48 rats / 3 rats per pool X 4 tissues = 64 pooled samples *Note - In some cases, pools may contain less than 3 rats due to death of animal. == Animals are on a twelve-hour light/dark cycle (light 6AM-6PM). The rats  diet is Teklad chow with 0.4% NaCl (order # 3075S, see http://www.teklad.com/index.htm for more information) and water ad libitum. == At 10 weeks of age, animals are subjected to an environmental stressor. One group is moved to hypoxia conditioning chambers, while the second, normoxic, group is left at baseline/standard conditions. The hypoxia chambers maintain fixed rate airflow with 12% oxygen, while the standard oxygen level is 21%. == At 12 weeks, the rats are fasted, water ad libitum, for twelve hours  (+/- one hour) before sacrifice.  II. Tissue sampling at Medical College of Wisconsin  1) Tissue collection is performed in the necropsy room of MCWs Animal Resource Center (ARC). The following equipment is used in tissue collection setup: Transponder reader Decapicones(R) Labeled 50ml tubes containing RNAlater Labeled 1.5ml tubes for liver DNA sample Dissecting tools Saline Cotton swabs Gauze pads Liquid Nitrogen Guillotine Dissecting board w/ rib spreaders 2) Fasting begins at 10PM. Tissue collection begins at 10AM and is completed within two hours. 3) Three technicians contribute to the tissue collection. One \"clean\"  technician organizes the collection process and keeps records, while two  harvest tissues. The procedure is done as follows: a) Confirm all animal ID #s with transponder reader and record on tissue harvest pool form b) Place a conscious, non-anesthetized rat into a plastic restraint cone and decapitate, with the head falling directly into liquid nitrogen. Drain blood until muscle activity ceases and then open the rat at the midline. c) Remove and mince heart, right kidney, one liver lobe, and one lung lobe into individual labeled tubes containing 15ml RNAlater(TM), with no pieces larger than 0.5cm in one direction. (A liver sample is also taken for DNA archival at MCW and collected in 1.5ml screw top tube.) d) Remove the transponder from the rat and dispose of the carcass in ARC burn cooler. e) Rinse dissecting tools with sterile saline between animals within a pool. f) Procedure is repeated with tissues from two additional rats being pooled into the same tube. g) Replace saline between pools. 4) Tissues are places in 4°C refrigerator following collection for up to  1 month, then placed @ -20°C for archival.  III. RNA extraction at Medical College of Wisconsin  ]] Equipment used in RNA extraction: Trizol(TM) reagent Chloroform Isopropanol 75% Ethanol Powergen homogenizer Saw tooth generators (7X195mm and 10X195mm) Centrifuge (capable of 12000Xg) 50ml and 15ml conical tubes Microcentrifuge tubes 1) Remove the tissue from RNAlater and weigh; add 1ml of Trizol reagent(TM) per 100mg of tissue to 50ml conical tube, with a maximum of 500mg of tissue homogenized at once. 2) Homogenize tissue pools in Trizol using a saw tooth generator (7X195mm or 10X195mm) on a Powergen homogenizer. 3) Incubate the homogenate at room temperature for five minutes, and then add 0.2ml of chloroform per 1ml of Trizol used. Shake sample for 15 sec by hand, then incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. 4) Spin the samples at 10,000Xg, 4-8°C, for 15 minutes. 5) Transfer aqueous layer to new 15ml tube and add 0.5ml Isopropanol per 1ml of Trizol. (An aliquot of RNA in isopropanol, approximately 1.5ml, is archived at MCW at -80°C.) Incubate samples at room temperature for 15 minutes, and then repeat spin. 6) Remove isopropanol and wash pellet, containing RNA, with 75% Ethanol. Air-dry tubes for 10 minutes to evaporate ethanol. 7) Re-suspend the pellet with Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water and warm to 55°C for 10 minutes. Repeat spin (step 4) for five minutes to removed any material not in solution. 8) Place supernatant, containing RNA, in a new microcentrifuge tube. 9) Measure the samples spectrophotometrically at 260/280nm to obtain RNA concentration. 10) Store the samples at -80°C.  IV. RNA clean up  == The extracted RNA pool is run through Qiagens RNeasy midi kit to remove any remaining genomic DNA or degraded RNA. Kit contains buffers and tubes, user must supply 96-100% Ethanol, ß-Mercaptoethanol, and DNase (optional). All centrifugation steps are done at 3000-5000Xg. The Qiagen RNA cleanup protocol is used with an optional DNase treatment, as follows: 1) Bring sample up to volume with water, as indicated in chart. 2) Add Buffer RLT, according to chart above, and mix. 3) Add 100% Ethanol and shake, and then apply 4ml of sample to RNeasy midi column in 15ml tube. 4) Centrifuge for five minutes at 3000-5000Xg (If sample volume is over 4ml, discard flow through and repeat spin with remaining sample). 5) Optional DNase treatment- Total RNA in sample Add DEPC H20 to Buffer RLT Ethanol &lt;500µg 500µl 2.0ml 1.4ml  500-1000µg 1000µl 4.0ml 2.8ml a) Pipet 2ml Buffer RW1 into column and spin for 5 minutes, then discard flow through. b) Combine 20ul DNase I stock with 140ul Buffer RDD for each sample, and add to column. c) Incubate at room temp for 15 min. d) Add 2ml RW1 and incubate at room temp 5 min, then repeat spin for 5 min. 6) Discard flow-through and add 2.5ml Buffer RPE, and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard flow-through and add another 2.5 ml RPE, and repeat centrifuge 5 min. 7) Place column in new 15ml tube and add 250µl DEPC water, let stand 1 min, centrifuge (as in s 3 min to elute RNA (use only 150µl water if sample is less than 150µg RNA). 8) Repeat elution (can use first elute for increased concentration, but  yield will be decreased) 9) The concentration of the samples is measured as before and 1ug of sample  is run on a 1% agarose gel to assess quality (Gel images are stored at MCW). 10) Total RNA is stored at -80°C in labeled 2ml tubes until shipment. 11) Samples are then sent to TIGR, by priority overnight shipment on dry ice,  for microarray analysis.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Cardiovascular disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The TIGR rodent expression web-based resource (TREX) contains over 2,200 microarray hybridizations, involving over 800 animals from 18 different rat strains. These strains comprise genetically diverse parental animals and a panel of chromosomal substitution strains derived by introgressing individual chromosomes from normotensive Brown Norway (BN/NHsdMcwi) rats into the background of Dahl salt sensitive (SS/JrHsdMcwi) rats. The profiles document gene-expression changes in both genders, four tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney) and two environmental conditions (normoxia, hypoxia). This translates into almost 400 high-quality direct comparisons (not including replicates) and over 100,000 pairwise comparisons. As each individual chromosomal substitution strain represents on average less than a 5% change from the parental genome, consomic strains provide a useful mechanism to dissect complex traits and identify causative genes. We performed a variety of data-mining manipulations on the profiles and used complementary physiological data from the PhysGen resource to demonstrate how TREX can be used by the cardiovascular community for hypothesis generation.</field>

      <name>Fetal Rat Testis mRNA Expression after 50 mg/kg Dibutyl Phthalate Exposure</name>
      <description>High dose level dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure of fetal rat testes in vivo inhibits testosterone production (i.e. endocrine disruption).  Here, fetal testis mRNA levels were profiled following exposure to a DBP dose level that did not significantly reduce testosterone levels.  The goal was to identify the constellation of gene expression changes that do not correlate with endocrine disruption. Fischer 344 rats were exposed via oral gavage of the dam to vehicle (corn oil) or 50 mg/kg (body weight) DBP daily from gestational day (GD) 12 to 20.  The day after mating was defined as gestational day 0.  Six hours after the final exposure on GD20, fetal testes were dissected and mRNA levels quantified using Affymetrix Rat Expression 230 2.0 microarrays.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Fetal rat phthalate exposure produces a spectrum of male reproductive tract malformations downstream of reduced Leydig cell testosterone production, but the molecular mechanism of phthalate perturbation of Leydig cell function is not well understood. By bioinformatically examining fetal testis expression microarray data sets from susceptible (rat) and resistant (mouse) species after dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure, we identified decreased expression of several metabolic pathways in both species. However, lipid metabolism pathways transcriptionally regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) were inhibited in the rat but induced in the mouse, and this differential species response corresponded with repression of the steroidogenic pathway. In rats exposed to 100 or 500 mg/kg DBP from gestational days (GD) 16 to 20, a correlation was observed between GD20 testis steroidogenic inhibition and reductions of testis cholesterol synthesis endpoints including testis total cholesterol levels, Srebf2 gene expression, and cholesterol synthesis pathway gene expression. SREBP2 expression was detected in all fetal rat testis cells but was highest in Leydig cells. Quantification of SREBP2 immunostaining showed that 500 mg/kg DBP exposure significantly reduced SREBP2 expression in rat fetal Leydig cells but not in seminiferous cords. By Western analysis, total rat testis SREBP2 levels were not altered by DBP exposure. Together, these data suggest that phthalate-induced inhibition of fetal testis steroidogenesis is closely associated with reduced activity of several lipid metabolism pathways and SREBP2-dependent cholesterologenesis in Leydig cells.</field>

      <name>RNA-seq analysis of recombinant Synechocystis sp. 6803 provides important insights for understanding polyhydroxyalkanoate production in cyanobacteria under photoautotrophic conditions</name>
      <description>The direct photosynthetic production of polyhydroxyalkanoate in cyanobacteria was improved by increasing carbon flux to biosynthetic pathway and introducing enzyme with higher activity. To understand the global transcriptional changes under photoautotrophic PHA biosynthesis conditions, RNA-seq analysis was performed. Transcriptomes of recombinant Synechocystis sp. with different PHA-producing potential (three strains, two biological replicates for each strain) were analyzed.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Genomic structural variation is an important and abundant source of genetic and phenotypic variation. We report an initial analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) in cattle selected for resistance or susceptibility to intestinal nematodes. We performed three array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments to compare Angus cattle with extreme phenotypes for fecal egg count and serum pepsinogen level. We identified 20 CNVs in total, of which 12 were within known chromosomes harboring or adjacent to gains or losses. About 85% of the CNV identified (17/20) overlapped with cattle CNV regions that were reported recently. Selected CNVs were further validated by independent methods using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and FISH. Pathway analyses indicated that annotated cattle genes within these variable regions are particularly enriched for immune function affecting receptor activities, signal transduction, and transcription. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes suggested that common transcription factors are probably involved in parasite resistance. These results provide valuable hypotheses for the future study of cattle CNVs underlying economically important health and production traits.</field>

      <name>Comparison of gene expression profile of gilthead seabream mineralization-induced VSa16 cells against controls</name>
      <description>In the present study, the Agilent-016251 Sparus aurata oligo microarray platform (GEO accession: GPL6467) was used to compare expression profiles of mineralization-induced VSa16 cell cultures against untreated ones. ECM mineralization was induced for 4 weeks by supplementing medium with 50 µg/ml of L-ascorbic acid, 10 mM β glycerophosphate and 4 mM CaCl2. For each group, total RNA was extracted from three (3) independent biological replicates, each consisting of pools of cells. Data analysis demonstrated that expression profiles were strongly affected by ECM mineralization with hundreds of genes differentially expressed with relevant fold-change. In this study, we analyzed six (6) cell samples, three (3) collected from untreated VSa16 cell cultures and three (3) collected from mineralization-induced VSa16 cell cultures. Gene expression profiling was performed using Agilent-016251 Sparus aurata oligo microarray platform (GPL6467) (6 arrays, no replicate) based on single-colour detection (Cyanine-3 only). Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (barcode on the left, DNA on the back surface, scanned through the glass) at a resolution of 5 microns; all slides were scanned twice at two different sensitivity settings (XDRHi 100% and XDRLo 10%); the scanner software created a unique ID for each pair of XDR scans and saved it to both scan image files. Feature Extraction (FE) 9.5 used XDR ID to link the pairs of scans together automatically when extracting data. The signal that was left after all the FE processing steps was ProcessedSignal that contains the Multiplicatively Detrended, Background-Subtracted Signal.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Library Construction - P17 cells were derived from the mouse epididymal cell line PC1 by genetic modification to express a tagged wild type mouse AR cDNA (N-TAP-mAR). N-TAP-mAR allows purification of multi-protein complexes and their genomic targets with FLAG antibody coupled magnetic beads under native conditions. 200 to 300bp DNA fraction purified from an agarose gel was submitted to Source BioScience for library preparation. Nano drop measurements were: PC1 33C: 2.7 ng/ul in 25ul and PC17 33C: 7.7 ng/ul in 30ul and PC17 37C: 6.3 ng/ul in 30ul. Linkers used for library preparation are unknown. For library validation Source Bioscience checks routinely fragment size, yield and concentration with Agilent Bioanalyzer. Technical Specifications point out that for cluster generation, the library hybridized to the flow cell and series of bridge amplification occurred resulting in the generation of approximately 1000 copies for each template. They expected to see up to 25 million high quality clusters formed on each lane of the flow cell. Sequencing was done by synthesis with nucleotides designed to have reversible termination property, which allows each cycle of the sequencing reaction to occur simultaneously for all 4 nucleotides.</field>

For P17 37°C 85269237 reads out of 92901239 raw reads were mapped, for P17 33°C 51480433 reads out of 64560744 raw reads were mapped and for PC1 control 46952666 reads out of 56095836 raw reads were mapped. Genomic regions and peaks were determined using MACS peak finder (Zhang et al., 2008). Data tables showing the peak analysis results listed as chromosome number, peak region start and end position on target (bp), length of the peak region (bp), the position of the peak maximum relative to the start position (summit) [bp], the peak intensity value representing the number of reads per peak region (tags) and the statistical significance of the peak, i.e. how likely calls MACS the peak as true signal by accident (=pValue). The length of the peak regions does not match the length of the isolated gel fraction in the agarose gel. Average Peak region length for PC1 33C is 773bps, for P17 33C: 795bps and P17 37C: 2.8kb.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Hematophagy is a common trait of insect vectors of disease. Extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes occur in mosquitoes after blood meals, and these are related to digestive and reproductive processes, among others. Studies of these changes are expected to reveal molecular targets for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies. The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae), a vector of Dengue viruses, Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and Chikungunya virus (CV), is the subject of this study to look at genome-wide changes in gene expression following a blood meal.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Transcriptional changes that follow a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females were explored using RNA-seq technology. Over 30% of more than 18,000 investigated transcripts accumulate differentially in mosquitoes at five hours after a blood meal when compared to those fed only on sugar. Forty transcripts accumulate only in blood-fed mosquitoes. The list of regulated transcripts correlates with an enhancement of digestive activity and a suppression of environmental stimuli perception and innate immunity. The alignment of more than 65 million high-quality short reads to the Ae. aegypti reference genome permitted the refinement of the current annotation of transcript boundaries, as well as the discovery of novel transcripts, exons and splicing variants. Cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and cis-regulatory modules (CRM) enriched significantly at the 5'end flanking sequences of blood meal-regulated genes were identified.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">This study provides the first global view of the changes in transcript accumulation elicited by a blood meal in Ae. aegypti females. This information permitted the identification of classes of potentially co-regulated genes and a description of biochemical and physiological events that occur immediately after blood feeding. The data presented here serve as a basis for novel vector control and pathogen transmission-blocking strategies including those in which the vectors are modified genetically to express anti-pathogen effector molecules.</field>

      <name>Early Leaf Development: A not so gradual process</name>
      <description>Early leaf growth is sustained by cell proliferation and subsequent cell expansion that initiates at the leaf tip and proceeds in a basipetal direction. Using detailed kinematic and gene expression studies to map these stages during early development of the third leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana we showed that the cell cycle arrest front did not progress gradually down the leaf, but rather was established and abolished abruptly. Interestingly, leaf greening and stomatal patterning followed a similar basipetal pattern, but proliferative pavement cell and formative meristemoid divisions were uncoordinated in respect to onset and persistence. Genes differentially expressed during the transition from cell proliferation to expansion were enriched in genes involved in cell cycle, photosynthesis, and chloroplast retrograde signaling. Proliferating primordia treated with norflurazon, a chemical inhibitor of retrograde signaling, showed inhibited onset of cell expansion. Hence, differentiation of the photosynthetic machinery is important for regulating the exit from proliferation. GSM839070-GSM839081: Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from leaf 3 of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in vitro and treated or not treated with norflurazon (NF) at 8 days after stratification (DAS) and harvested 24 and 48 hours after treatment. RNA from three biological repeats of each timepoint and treatment were submitted to AGRONOMICS1 array hybridization. GSM839082-GSM839099: Total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) from leaf 3 of Arabidopsis seedlings 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 days after stratification (DAS) and grown in vitro. RNAs from three biological repeats of each timepoint were submitted to AGRONOMICS1 array hybridization.</description>

      <name>Vascular histone deacetylation by pharmacological HDAC inhibition [SAHA, ChIP-seq]</name>
      <description>HDAC inhibitors are thought to regulate gene expression by post-translational modification of histone as well as non-histone proteins. Often studied at single loci, increased histone acetylation is the paradigmatic mechanism of action, however, little is known of the extent of genome-wide changes of the mammalian genome when stimulated by the hydroxamic acids, TSA and SAHA. In primary human vascular endothelial cells we map the chromatin modifications, histone H3 acetylation of lysine 9 and 14 (H3K9/14ac) using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). Since acetylation mediated gene expression is often associated with modification of other lysine residues we also examined H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 as well as changes in CpG methylation (CpG-seq). Genome-wide mRNA sequencing indicates the differential expression of about 30% of genes, with almost equal numbers being up- and down- regulated. We observe deacetylation conferred by TSA and SAHA that are associated with decreased gene expression. Histone deacetylation is associated with the loss of p300/CBP binding at gene promoters. This study provides an important framework for HDAC inhibitor function in vascular biology and a comprehensive description of genome-wide deacetylation. HAEC ChIP-seq profiles for 3 histone marks of SAHA treated and control samples were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Primary HAECs (human aortic endothelial cells), purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA), were cultured in EBM-2 medium (Lonza) containing EGM-2 growth factors and supplements (Lonza) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).
 Sample Treatment - HAEC were incubated for 12 hours with 500 nM SAHA.
 Library Construction - After the incubation,HAECs were fixed for 10 minutes with 1% formaldehyde. Glycine (0.125 M) solution was then added for another 10 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Then cells were sonicated to shear chromatin and ChIP was performed using indicated above antibodies and DynaMag™-2 magnet (Invitrogen). Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the DNA Sample Kit. Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3’ end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols.</field>

      <name>miRNA expression data from the hearts of murine myocardial infarction model</name>
      <description>Sexual dimorphisms are well recognized in various cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). MI develops later in women, but once established, it contributes more persistent symptoms and higher mortality than in men. Similar observations have been reported in murine model of MI. Although mRNA-level sexual dimorphism of MI have been reported, whether miRNA transcriptome also confers such dimorphism remains unknown. Comprehensive understanding of the mRNA- and miRNA-level genetic programs underlying the heart sexual dimorphisms will expectedly improve clinical outcome by facilitating the development of gender specific treatment strategies. Here, by conducting miRNA microarray analysis of murine MI model samples, we set out to characterize the heart sexual dimorphisms at the level of miRNA transcriptome The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery of mice aged 10 weeks was surgically ligated to create extensive MI. The ventricular septum of the areas at risk of ischemia was sampled on post-operative day 28. Total RNA was extracted using Sepasol solution (Sepasol-RNA I super G, nakalai tesque, Japan), and microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 Arrays</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of doxazosin response in human prostatic stromal cells</name>
      <description>BACKGROUND: We used cDNA microarray analysis to obtain insights into the mechanisms of action of doxazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS: Hierarchical clustering analysis and significance analysis of microarray (SAM) were performed to identify genes differentially expressed between untreated stromal cells cultured from normal tissue and BPH, and changes in gene expression induced by doxazosin. Transcript levels of selected genes were validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering analyses separated untreated normal and BPH cells. Sixty-seven genes whose expression varied at least twofold after doxazosin treatment in both normal and BPH cells were identified, as were 93 genes differentially regulated in normal versus BPH cells. Molecular targets consistent with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-related activity were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Normal versus BPH stromal cells differ in global gene transcription. Doxazosin induced gene expression changes relevant to proliferation/apoptosis, immune defense, cell-cell signaling/signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <name>Distinctive microRNA profiles relating to patient survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</name>
      <description>We have investigated expressed microRNA in cryo-preserved esophageal cancer tissues using advanced microRNA microarray techniques.  Our microarray analyses reveal a unique microRNA expression signature composed of 40 genes which can distinguish normal from malignant esophageal tissue.  Some microRNAs could be correlated with the different clinico-pathological classifications.  For example, high hsa-miR-103, -107, -23b expression correlated with poor overall disease-free survival of esophageal cancer patients.  These results indicate that microRNA expression profiles are important diagnostic and prognostic markers of esophageal cancer, which might be analyzed simply using economical approaches such as RT-PCR.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridization was performed at 42C under LifterSlipTM (Erie, Portsmouth, NH) in a hybridization chamber which was placed in a 3D-tilting agitator BioMixerTM  II (CapitalBio) to provide continuous mixing of the hybridization buffer that results in more uniform hybridization across the entire slide surface, preventing edge effects and giving improved signal intensity, the efficiency of which has been demonstrated with our genome-wide mRNA expression profiling (Patterson et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2006, 24:1140-1150).The array was then washed with two consecutive washing solutions of 0.2% SDS, 2X SSC at 42 C for 5 min, and 0.2% SSC for 5 min at room temperature.
 Labeling - 4 ug of low-molecular-weight RNA was labeled with 500 ng of 5'-phosphate-cytidyl-uridyl-cy3-3' (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) with 2 units T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).  The labeling reaction was performed at 4C for 2 h.  Labeled RNA was precipitated with 0.3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes ethanol and after washing with ethanol and drying was resuspended in 15 ul of hybridization buffer containing 3X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 15% formamide.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the low-molecular-weight RNA was isolated by using the Ambion miRNA Isolation Kit</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = the signal intensity after calibration
 Feature Extraction - After average values of the replicate spots of each miRNA were background subtracted, faint spots were filtered out when expression signal were lower than 800 in all samples.  Signal was normalized using the median center tool for genes in the Cluster 3.0 software before performing the unsupervised clustering with complete linkage and uncentered Pearson correlation to underlying the structure of the miRNA expression (Eisen MB, Spellman PT, Brown PO, Botstein D. Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1998;95:14863-8).
 Image Adquisition - Arrays were scanned with a LuxScanTM 10K-A laser confocal scanner and the images obtained were then analyzed using LuxScan 3.0TM software (both from CapitalBio, Beijing, China).</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of death from cancer and one of the least studied cancers worldwide. The global microRNA expression profile of esophageal cancer has not been reported previously. Here, for the first time, we have investigated expressed microRNAs in cryopreserved esophageal cancer tissues using advanced microRNA microarray techniques. Our microarray analyses identified seven microRNAs that could distinguish malignant esophageal cancer lesions from adjacent normal tissues. Some microRNAs could be correlated with the different clinicopathologic classifications. High expression of hsa-miR-103/107 correlated with poor survival by univariate analysis as well as by multivariate analysis. These results indicate that microRNA expression profiles are important diagnostic and prognostic markers of esophageal cancer, which might be analyzed simply using economical approaches such as reverse transcription-PCR.</field>

      <name>miRNA expression of whole hippocampus 24hr post-injury in rat</name>
      <description>Traumatic brain injury dysregulates microRNA expression in the brain. We hypothesized that injury-induced epigenetic changes contribute to neurodegeneration and learning and memory deficits after TBI. These changes may provide a mechanistic explanation for neuropsychiatric comorbidities in TBI patients. Our objective is to compare and contrast the effects of several neuroprotective drugs (JM6, PMI-006 and E33-estrogen) on the TBI-induced changes in microRNA expression in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is critical for learning and memory. We will also study if different neuroprotective drugs have similar effects on common microRNAs which may cooperatively regulate a common set of gene targets. 3 biological samples each of Naïve, Sham control, TBI and TBI plus JM6, TI plus PMI-006, and TBI plus E33 rat hippocampi were obtained 24 hr post-sham injury or TBI, stored in RNA later and sent to GenUs Biosystems for microRNA microarray analysis.</description>

      <name>High-resolution genome-wide in vivo footprinting of diverse transcription factors in human cells (ChIP-seq)</name>
      <description>Using DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS) assays (Dnase-seq), high resolution DNaseI digestion profiles were generated genome-wide in diverse human cell types.  We showed that within general regions of DNaseI HS that are known to identify locations of gene regulatory elements, DNaseI digestion patterns allowed us to identify locations of individual transcription factor binding sites that protected against the bound DNA against digestion. To measure the accuracy of these footprints, we also generated ChIP-seq data for the CTCF DNA binding factor in the same cell growths.  We found that DNaseI footprints containing the CTCF canonical binding motif show significant ChIP-seq signal while CTCF binding motifs not in footprints show almost no signal providing one measure of valdation of the DNaseI footprints.  For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf Five cell lines representing cervica carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, embryonic stem cells, epidermal keratinocytes, and umbilical vein endothelial cells were analyzed using ChIP-seq.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols.Specific protocol descriptions can be found at http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html.
 Library Construction - Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3’ end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols. To perform ChIP, proteins were cross-linked to DNA in vivo using 1% formaldehyde solution (Bhinge et al., 2007, ENCODE Project Consortium., 2007). Cross-linked chromatin was sheared by sonication and immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody against the protein of interest. After reversal of the cross-links, the immunoprecipitated DNA was used to identify the genomic location of transcription factor binding. This was accomplished by Solexa sequencing of the ends of the immunoprecipitated DNA (ChIP-seq), as well as labeling and hybridization of the immunoprecipitated DNA to NimbleGen Human ENCODE tiling arrays (1% of the genome) along with the input DNA as reference (ChIP-chip). The ENCODE array data were used to verify the accuracy of the sequencing data, and multiple independent growths (replicates) were compared to assess the reproducibility of the data</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Feature Extraction - Sequences from each experiment were aligned to the genome using Maq (Li et al., 2008) and those that aligned to 4 or fewer locations were retained. Other sequences were also filtered based on their alignment to problematic regions (such as satellites and rRNA genes). The resulting digital signal was converted to a continuous wiggle track using F-Seq (http://www.genome.duke.edu/labs/furey/software/fseq/) that employs Parzen kernel density estimation to create base pair scores (Boyle et al., 2008b). Discrete sites (peaks) were identified from ChIP-seq using by setting a F-Seq score cutoff based on fitting these data to a gamma distribution and determining the threshold at a p-value of 0.05.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The human body contains thousands of unique cell types, each with specialized functions. Cell identity is governed in large part by gene transcription programs, which are determined by regulatory elements encoded in DNA. To identify regulatory elements active in seven cell lines representative of diverse human cell types, we used DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) to map "open chromatin." Over 870,000 DNaseI or FAIRE sites, which correspond tightly to nucleosome-depleted regions, were identified across the seven cell lines, covering nearly 9% of the genome. The combination of DNaseI and FAIRE is more effective than either assay alone in identifying likely regulatory elements, as judged by coincidence with transcription factor binding locations determined in the same cells. Open chromatin common to all seven cell types tended to be at or near transcription start sites and to be coincident with CTCF binding sites, while open chromatin sites found in only one cell type were typically located away from transcription start sites and contained DNA motifs recognized by regulators of cell-type identity. We show that open chromatin regions bound by CTCF are potent insulators. We identified clusters of open regulatory elements (COREs) that were physically near each other and whose appearance was coordinated among one or more cell types. Gene expression and RNA Pol II binding data support the hypothesis that COREs control gene activity required for the maintenance of cell-type identity. This publicly available atlas of regulatory elements may prove valuable in identifying noncoding DNA sequence variants that are causally linked to human disease.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Regulation of gene transcription in diverse cell types is determined largely by varied sets of cis-elements where transcription factors bind. Here we demonstrate that data from a single high-throughput DNase I hypersensitivity assay can delineate hundreds of thousands of base-pair resolution in vivo footprints in human cells that precisely mark individual transcription factor-DNA interactions. These annotations provide a unique resource for the investigation of cis-regulatory elements. We find that footprints for specific transcription factors correlate with ChIP-seq enrichment and can accurately identify functional versus nonfunctional transcription factor motifs. We also find that footprints reveal a unique evolutionary conservation pattern that differentiates functional footprinted bases from surrounding DNA. Finally, detailed analysis of CTCF footprints suggests multiple modes of binding and a novel DNA binding motif upstream of the primary binding site.</field>

      <name>DNA microarrays of Turner Syndrome induced pluripotent stem cells</name>
      <description>We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X (Turner Syndrome), trisomy 8 (Warkany Syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel Syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests. These cell lines stably maintain the karyotype of the donors and behave like embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in all tested assays. Turner Syndrome iPSCs were used for further studies including global gene expression analysis and tissue-specific directed differentiation. Multiple clones displayed lower levels of the pseudoautosomal genes ASMTL and PPP2R3B than the controls. Moreover, they could be transformed into neural-like, hepatocyte-like and heart-like cells but displayed insufficient up-regulation of the pseudoautosomal placental gene CSF2RA during embryoid body (EB) formation. These data support that abnormal organogenesis and early lethality in Turner Syndrome are not caused by a tissue-specific differentiation blockade but rather involves other abnormalities including impaired placentation. Global gene expression profiling with DNA microarrays showed that 3 TS iPSC clones corresponding to the same patient showed a global gene expression pattern similar to ESCs and euploid iPSCs, and very different from donor cells .We detected transcriptomic changes between TS iPSCs and the other ESCs/iPSCs but these variations did not follow a pattern and in fact all pluripotent cell lines clustered together. For DNA microarray analysis, all cells were treated with Trizol, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Many human diseases share a developmental origin that manifests during childhood or maturity. Aneuploid syndromes are caused by supernumerary or reduced number of chromosomes and represent an extreme example of developmental disease, as they have devastating consequences before and after birth. Investigating how alterations in gene dosage drive these conditions is relevant because it might help treat some clinical aspects. It may also provide explanations as to how quantitative differences in gene expression determine phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility among natural populations. Here, we aimed to produce induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that can be used to improve our understanding of aneuploid syndromes. We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X [Turner syndrome (TS)], trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests. These cell lines stably maintain the karyotype of the donors and behave like embryonic stem cells in all tested assays. TS iPSCs were used for further studies including global gene expression analysis and tissue-specific directed differentiation. Multiple clones displayed lower levels of the pseudoautosomal genes ASMTL and PPP2R3B than the controls. Moreover, they could be transformed into neural-like, hepatocyte-like and heart-like cells, but displayed insufficient up-regulation of the pseudoautosomal placental gene CSF2RA during embryoid body formation. These data support that abnormal organogenesis and early lethality in TS are not caused by a tissue-specific differentiation blockade, but rather involves other abnormalities including impaired placentation.</field>

      <description>KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule.  KRAP-deficient (KRAP-/-) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia.  KRAP-/- mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Obesity and related metabolic disorders have become leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality. KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule, however, its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that KRAP-deficient (KRAP(-/-)) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia. KRAP(-/-) mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. Notably, glucose uptake in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in KRAP(-/-) mice is enhanced in an insulin-independent manner, suggesting that BAT is involved in altered energy homeostasis in KRAP(-/-) mice, although UCP (Uncoupling protein) expressions are not altered. Of interest is the down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism-related molecules, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-1, ACC-2 and fatty acid synthase in the liver of KRAP(-/-) mice, which could in part account for the metabolic phenotype in KRAP(-/-) mice. Thus, KRAP is a novel regulator in whole-body energy homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in obesity and related diseases.</field>

      <name>Choline transporter-like1 is required for plasmodesmal targeting of Potato leafroll virus movement protein MP17 and long-distance assimilate transport</name>
      <description>Macromolecular trafficking and cell-to-cell communication in plants occurs via plasmodesmata (PD). Currently, little is known about the proteins defining these sophisticated cell-to-cell contacts. To uncover proteins required for PD structure and function we made use of the 17 kDa movement protein (MP17) of the Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). The protein is required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus and localizes specifically to branched PD in source tissues. By forward genetic screening for Arabidopsis mutants with altered PD binding of MP17, several mutants were found. Map-based cloning of one of these mutants revealed a mutation in the choline transporter-like 1 (CHER1) protein. The mutation abolished plasma membrane localization of the protein. As consequence phosphatidylcholine levels and PD binding of MP17 decreased. Transcriptome analysis revealed a down-regulation of defense genes and genes involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, indicating an impairment of lipid signaling. Furthermore, cher1 mutants showed a reduced assimilate export and stunted growth. These findings highlight the emerging role of phospholipids, especially in the context of PD structure and function as well as potential binding sites for plasma membrane- and PD-associated proteins, which has been neglected for a long time. light exposed source leaves from wild type Col-0, T-DNA insertion line cher1-4 and mutant cher1-5 (10 weeks old). Samples: per pool  2 source leaves from 4 different plants, taken in the afternoon; wildtype (WT): Col-0, cher1-4: T-DNA insertion line SALK-065853 (ecotype Col-0, kanamycin resistance), cher1-5: Col-0 with GGA -->GAA at position 740 of cds</description>

      <name>Myelodysplastic syndrome marrow stroma shows widespread aberrant hypermethylation that is abrogated by treatment with DNMT inhibitors</name>
      <description>The marrow microenvironment contributes to the pathogenesis of ineffective hematopoiesis in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). Since mutations and cytogenetic alterations are generally not present in marrow stromal cells, we hypothesized that epigenetic alterations may be responsible for altered stroma functionin MDS. Global DNA methylation of MDS marrow-derived stroma was analyzed by HELP assay and compared to healthy controls. MDS stroma showed aberrant hypermethylation that preferentially occurred outside of CpG islands and involved important signaling pathways.Comparison with stroma derived from 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) treated MDS patients revealed abrogation of aberrant methylation in treated samples. Integrative expression analysis revealed that the WNT pathway was epigenetically dysregulated in MDS stroma, and the WNT antagonists FRZB and SFRP1 were aberrantly hypermethylated and underexpressed. These epigenetic changes were validated ina co-culture model of stroma and leukemic cells and in an independent set of MDS samples. Importantly, 5-Aza treatment of MDS stroma enhanced hematopoietic activity and erythroid differentiationfrom co-cultured healthy CD34+ cells. These results reveal widespread aberrant epigenetic changes in the MDS marrow microenvironment and demonstrate that DNA methyl transferase inhibitors alter the epigenomic profiles of stromal cells, potentiallycontributing to theirtherapeutic efficacy. The study population consisted of 6 MDS patients and 3 healthy controls. Individual HpaII restriction digest profiles were compared to an internal MspI digest control, to yield differentially methylated fragments for every sample.</description>

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Signal intensities at each HpaII amplifiable fragment were calculated as a robust (25% trimmed) mean of their component probe-level signal intensities. Any fragments found within the level of background MspI signal intensity, measured as 2.5 mean-absolute-differences (MAD) above the median of random probe signals, were categorized as “failed.” These “failed” loci therefore represent the population of fragments that did not amplify by PCR, whatever the biological (e.g. genomic deletions and other sequence errors) or experimental cause. On the other hand, “Methylated” loci were so designated when the level of HpaII signal intensity was similarly indistinguishable from background.PCR-amplifying fragments (those not flagged as either “methylated” or “failed”) were normalized using an intra-array quantile approach wherein HpaII/MspI ratios are aligned across density-dependent sliding windows of fragment size-sorted data (described in detail in Thompson et al, Bioinformatics 2008;24:1161-1167.)

      <name>GRHL1 acts as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma and is negatively regulated by MYCN and HDAC3</name>
      <description>Neuroblastoma is an embryonic solid tumor of neural crest origin and accounts for 11% of all cancer-related deaths in children. Novel therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently required. MYCN oncogene amplification, which occurs in 20% of neuroblastomas, is a hallmark of high risk. Here we aimed to exploit molecular mechanisms that can be pharmacologically addressed with epigenetically modifying drugs, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. GRHL1, a gene critical for Drosophila neural development, belonged to the genes most strongly responding to HDAC inhibitor treatment of neuroblastoma cells in a genome- wide screen. An increase in the histone H4 pan-acetylation associated with its promoter preceded transcriptional activation. Physically adjacent, HDAC3 and MYCN co-localized to the GRHL1 promoter and repressed its transcription. High-level GRHL1 expression in primary neuroblastomas correlated on transcriptional and translational levels with favorable patient survival and established clinical and molecular markers for favorable tumor biology, including lack of MYCN amplification. Enforced GRHL1 expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells with low endogenous GRHL1 levels abrogated anchorage-independent colony formation, inhibited proliferation and retarded xenograft growth in mice. GRHL1 regulated 170 genes genome-wide, and most were involved in pathways regulated during neuroblastomagenesis, including nervous system development, proliferation, cell-cell adhesion, cell spreading and cellular differentiation. In summary, the data presented here indicate a significant role of HDAC3 in the MYCN-mediated repression of GRHL1 and suggest drugs that block HDAC3 activity and suppress MYCN expression as promising candidates for novel treatment strategies of high-risk neuroblastoma. Twelve samples were analyzed. Each 2 replicated of paired empty vector control and GRHL1 forced expression at 3 different time points.</description>

      <name>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of cytoskeleton regulator genes in 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mouse brain cortex</name>
      <description>The goal of this study was to identify brain cortex gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Cytoskeleton Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-088A) from SABiosciences. Mice used in this study were 2 week old males. Total RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates. For this study, cortical tissue from 3 mice of each genotype was used and RNA from the cortex of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.  The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Cytoskeleton Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-088A).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Heterozygous MeCP2 A140V females produced in our mouse colony were bred with wild type male C57BL/6 mice to produce the male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous and wild type littermate mice used in these experiments. All breeding and experimentation was conducted in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.
 Sample Treatment - no treatment
 Hybridization - n/a
 Labeling - PCR assays were performed using the Mouse Cytoskeleton Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-088A) from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed from 1 µg total RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SA Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR using the cDNA was then performed on an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine using this protocol: 10 minutes at 95ºC followed by 40 cycles of (95ºC for 15 seconds, 55ºC for 40 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mice and their male wild type littermates (n=3 for each group). TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used to extract the RNA from homogenized brain tissue. RNA was then purified using the SA Biosciences (Frederick, Maryland) RT2 qPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit. Turbo DNA-free from Ambion (Austin, Texas) was used to remove residual genomic DNA from the samples. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA for each sample using SA Biosciences RT2 First-Strand Kit.

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Experiments used an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine. Ct thresholds were manually set within the linear phase of the logarithmic amplification plots using Opticon Monitor 3 software. Data from the logarithmic plots was exported and analyzed using the downloadable Excel PCR Array Data Analysis Template version 2.0 provided by SA Biosciences (http://sabiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php). This template uses the ΔΔCt method to establish the fold change between control and experimental groups. It also uses a two-tailed student’s t test to establish statistical significance using p&lt;0.05. A set of 5 housekeeping genes (Gapdh, Actb, HSP90ab1, Hprt1, and Gusb), which are included on the array plates, was used for normalization. This was done by subtracting the average Ct value of the housekeeping genes in each sample from the Ct values of the genes of interest in that sample. The 'non-normalized.txt' reports raw Ct values before normalization. The 'fold_change.txt' reports test/control (i.e., MeCP2 A140V/wildtype) ratios [available as Series supplementary files] ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized signal (against housekeeping genes)</field>

      <description>Gene regulatory elements such as enhancers have profound effects on cellular function, health, and disease. Our understanding of mammalian enhancer function is limited by the lack of a technology that would allow for a rapid and thorough test of their cell type-specific function. Here, we describe a novel Cas9-effector system that enables rapid testing and functional annotation of native enhancers in embryonic stem cells.

      <description>Identification of the molecular changes that promote viability and metastatic behaviour of prostate cancer cells is critical for the development of improved therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer. Stat5a/b and Stat3 are both constitutively active in locally-confined and advanced prostate cancer, and both transcription factors have been reported to be critical for the viability and growth of prostate cancer cells. We used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles regulated by Stat5a/b vs. Stat3 in human prostate cancer cells. DU145 and CWR22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells were transfected with Stat3 siRNA, Stat5a/b siRNA or scramble siRNA as control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared for Affymetrix microarrays.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells were cultured in PRMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 50IU/ml penicillin and 50mg/ml streptomycin.
 Sample Processing - DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNAs targeted to human Stat3 or Stat5a and Stat5b using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were harvested 48 h after the transfections.
 Hybridization - Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr on Human Genome 133 plus 2.0 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 2 ug total RNA.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen Rneasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Dnase I digestion step was included to eliminate DNA contamination. Each group (control-siRNA, Stat5a/b-siRNA and Stat3-siRNA) was done in triplicate and RNA samples from each group were not pooled. RNA was quantified on a Nanodrop ND-100 spectrophotometer, followed by RNA quality assessment on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = log2(RMA signal)
 Feature Extraction - The data was processed using R/Bioconductor. The raw data was pre-processed using RMA with the default settings of the Bioconductor library affy. The transcripts were filtered based on availability of EntrezID and GO annotation for each transcript. We also chose a single representative transcript for each Entrez ID based on the maximum variation in the expression within each cell line type (DU and CWR).  Analysis was carried out separately for the DU and CWR chips, by fitting a linear model to each transcript using the Bioconductor library limma, with the dependent variables being dummy variables indicating type (ctrl, stat3 or stat5).
 Image Adquisition - GeneChips were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 using the GeneChip Operating Software version 3.0.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Identification of the molecular changes that promote viability and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer is critical for the development of improved therapeutic interventions. Stat5a/b and Stat3 are both constitutively active in locally-confined and advanced prostate cancer, and both transcription factors have been reported to be critical for the viability of prostate cancer cells. We recently showed that Stat3 promotes metastatic behavior of human prostate cancer cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo experimental metastases model. In this work, we compare side-by-side Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in the promotion of prostate cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and induction of metastatic colonization in vivo. Inhibition of Stat5a/b induced massive death of prostate cancer cells in culture and reduced both subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumor growth, whereas Stat3 had a predominant role over Stat5a/b in promoting metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo in nude mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential biological effects induced by these two transcription factors involve largely different sets of genes regulated by Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in human prostate cancer model systems. Of the two Stat5 homologs, Stat5b was more important for supporting growth of prostate cancer cells than Stat5a. This work provides the first mechanistic comparison of the biological effects induced by transcription factors Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in prostate cancer.</field>

      <name>Transcriptome of human odontoblast, pre-secretory ameloblast and secretory ameloblast</name>
      <description>The goal of the study was to characterize the whole genome transcriptome profiles of human ameloblasts and odontoblasts, evaluate molecular pathways and advance our knowledge of the human tooth development. We found that during primary tooth formation, odontoblasts expressed 14,802 genes, presecretory ameloblasts 15,179 genes and secretory ameloblasts 14,526 genes. Four human fetuses were obtained at ages 15-20 weeks gestation, immediately placed on ice and the tooth buds dissected from the jaws, placed in RNAlater and refrigerated at 4C for 1-4 weeks to allow decalcification by EDTA. The tissue was then frozen and stored at -80C. The tissue was sectioned at -35C at a thickness of 7 microns. These sections were used for laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate the human odontoblasts and ameloblasts in different stages of enamel formation, using static image settings.  In total, 4 odontoblast, 4 pre-secretory ameloblast and 4 secretory ameloblast pooled samples were used for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.</description>

 Labeling - The TargetAmp™ 2-Round Aminoallyl-aRNA Amplification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) was used for the linear amplification process. 5 µg of amplified aRNA from the laser-captured tissue was labeled with the Cy5 dye and hybridized to the arrays with a Cy3-labeled Stratagene Human Universal Reference(Santa Clara, CA, USA).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated from the microdissected cells with the PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Arcturus Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
 Scaning - Scanned on an Agilent G2500 Scanner and data was extracted from the scanned image using Feature Extraction version 9.5 (Agilent Technologies).</field>

      <name>CREB3L1 Target Genes in Response to Hepatitis C Replicon Infection</name>
      <description>Membrane-bound transcription factor CREB3L1 undergoes Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) in response to Hepatitis C infection.  RIP activates CREB3L1 so that it can prevent the growth of HCV infected cells through the action of downstream genes.  We over-expressed a truncated form of CREB3L1 that does not require RIP to enter the nucleus.  Cells over-expressing this truncated form were isolated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). We used microarray to determine the downstream genes of CREB3L1 in comparison to a flow sorted empty vector control. HCV Replicon-containing cells were transfected with a CREB3L1Δ381-519 to determine the downstream genes.</description>

PURPOSE  This protocol describes the hybridization of a Cy labeled cDNA probe (mix of Cy3 and Cy5) onto coated slide spotted with PCR amplified cDNA.  2. SCOPE  This procedural format is currently utilized by Human Colon Cancer and Mouse microarray projects under the supervision of John Quackenbush within the Mammalian Genomics Dept.  3. MATERIALS  3.1 20X Saline-Sodium Citrate (SSC) (Sigma; Cat # S-6639) 3.2 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)(Life Technologies; Cat # 15553-035) 3.3 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma; Cat # A-9418) 3.4 Formamide, redistilled (Life Technologies; Cat # 15515-081) 3.5 Isopropanol (Fisher Scientific; Cat # A451-1) 3.6 Coplin jar (VWR; Cat # 25457-200) 3.7 Human COT1-DNA (Life Technologies; Cat # 15279-011) 3.8 Mouse COT1-DNA (Life Technologies; Cat # 18440-016) 3.9 Poly(A)-DNA (Pharmacia; Cat # 27-7836-01) 3.10 Microscope Cover Glass (Fisher Scientific; Cat # 12-545J) 3.11 Corning UltraGAPSä Coated Slides (bar-coded) (Corning; Cat # 40015) 3.12 Hybridization chamber (Corning Costar; Cat #2551) 3.13 1 L .22 mm CA (cellulose acetate) Filter System (Corning; Cat #430517) 3.14 Pressurized air duster (Fellowes; Cat # 99790) or clean in-house pressurized air source  4. PROCEDURE  4.1 UV Cross-linking and Prehybridizaton   4.1.1 Aminosilane coated slides (Corning UltraGAPSä Coated Slides) spotted with cDNA in 50% DMSO are UV cross-linked at ~120 mJ.  4.1.2 Prepare prehybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA) and sterilize by filtration using a CA filter.  Preheat at 42oC for ~30 minutes before use.    4.1.3 Place the printed slide(s) to be used for the hybridization in a Coplin jar containing preheated prehybridization buffer and incubate at 42oC for 45 minutes.  4.1.4 Washing Slides   - Fill two Coplin jars with MilliQ water and another with isopropanol. - With forceps carefully grasp slide by the labeled end and vertically dip slide into the first Coplin jar (water) so that the slide is completely submerged.  Dip slide four or five times. - Dip the slide again in the water five times but only submerging the slide enough to wash the printed array itself.  - Using the same technique dip slide into the second Coplin jar (water). - Finally dip slide into the third Coplin jar (isopropanol) submerging the slide completely.   Note: Replace each water wash after every five slides.  4.1.5 Drying Slides  -    Carefully but quickly blow-dry the front of the slide with compressed air.    Note:  To avoid blowing debris from the forceps onto the array, first blow from where the array ends toward the forceps.  Then dry the array itself by blowing down the slide away from the forceps.    -     Finally dry the back of the slide. - Note the general appearance of the slide.  Streaking or mottling on the slide surface indicates further washing is necessary. - Repeat the water/water/isopropanol wash cycle as necessary to clean the slide.  Blow-dry between each cycle.    4.1.6 Use slides immediately following prehybridization to ensure optimal hybridization efficiency.  4.2 Hybridization  4.2.1 Prepare 1X hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 0.1% SDS).    4.2.2 Prepare Poly(A)-DNA by dissolving stock Poly(A)-DNA in a neutral buffer (i.e. 10 mM Tris, pH 7) to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL.  4.2.3 Prepare COT1-DNA (stock conc.1mg/mL) by ethanol precipitation:  - Add 2 to 3 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate (NaOAc) to the stock tube. - Mix well and place on dry ice for 20-30 minutes or in -20oC freezer overnight.   - Centrifuge for 20-30 minutes in a cold room microfuge at maximum angular velocity. - Remove supernatant and allow excess ethanol to dry off. - Dissolve precipitated COT1 in a neutral buffer (i.e. 10 mM Tris, pH 7) to the final concentration of 20mg/mL.  4.2.4 Resuspend labeled probe (Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture: see SOP-M004) in 24 mL of 1X hybridization buffer.  Note: Expose Cy labeled probe to light as little as possible during the hybridization process.  4.2.5 To block nonspecific hybridization add:  COT1-DNA (20 mg/mL) ... 1mL  Poly(A)-DNA (20mg/mL) ... 1mL  Note: The COT1-DNA is organism specific: add mouse COT1 to labeled mouse probes and human COT1-DNA to labeled human probes.   4.2.6 To denature, heat the probe mixture at 95oC for 3 minutes and snap cool on ice for 30 sec.    4.2.7 Centrifuge the probe mixture at maximum angular velocity for 1 minute.  Keep at room temperature and use immediately.  4.2.8 To Apply Labeled Probe Mixture  - Place a prehybridized microarray slide (array side up) between the guide teeth in the bottom half of a hybridization chamber.   - Pipette the labeled probe mixture (~26 mL) to the slide surface near one end of the array print area keeping bubbles to a minimum. - Take a 22mm x 60mm microscope glass coverslip, dust it with compressed air, and grasp one end with forceps. - Holding the coverslip over the array print area, lower the end nearest the pool of cDNA probe until solution wicks to the surface of the coverslip. - Gradually lower the opposite end of the coverslip (held by the forceps) onto the slide.  The solution may take a minute or two to wick across the entire length of the slide. - After probe has wicked across the slide carefully adjust the coverslips position with the tip of the forceps so that there is an even margin between the edge of the coverslip and the edge of the slide. - Work any large bubbles toward the edge by gently tapping the coverslip surface; small bubbles will absolve themselves during hybridization.  4.2.9 To the small wells at each end of the chamber add 10 mL of water (20mL total), cover, and seal the chamber.  4.2.10 Wrap the chamber in foil (light-tight) and incubate in a 42oC water bath for 16-20 hours.  To ensure chamber remains level and does not float to the surface place a small weight upon it.  Note: Do not flip the hybridization chamber upside down during hybridization; this may cause the coverslip to shift from the slide and adversely affect the hybridization.  4.2.11 Prepare a low stringency wash buffer (~500mL) containing 1X SSC and 0.2% SDS and a high-stringency wash buffer (~500mL) containing 0.1X SSC and 0.2% SDS.  4.2.12 After the incubation remove foil and unseal hybridization chamber.  Remove the slide from the chamber, taking care not to disturb the coverslip.  4.2.13 To remove coverslip submerge slide in a dish containing low stringency wash buffer (preheated to 42oC).  With forceps shake the slide gently to loosen the coverslip.  With time the coverslip will slide free of the slide surface.  Note: Once the slide has been hybridized it should be exposed to light as little as possible.  Therefore, all staining dishes should be covered with foil to make them light tight.  4.2.14 After the coverslip is removed place slide in a staining dish containing lower stringency wash buffer (preheated to 42oC) and agitate for 4 minutes.  4.2.15 Wash the slide in a staining dish with high stringency wash buffer by agitating for 4 minutes at room temperature.  4.2.16 Wash the slide in 0.1X SSC agitating for 4 minutes at room temperature. (alternatively one can wash twice in 0.1X SSC agitating for 2.5 minutes to minimize SDS carryover.)  4.2.17 Finally dip the slide in a Coplin jar filled with water several times and blow dry using the same technique as step 4.1.4.  4.2.18 Place slides in a light tight slide box until they can be scanned, preferably as soon as possible.

Note:   Carbonate buffer changes composition over time; make it fresh  every couple of weeks to a month.  4.5  Cy-dye esters   4.5.1 Cy3-ester and Cy5-ester are provided as a dried product in 5 tubes.   Resuspend a tube of dye ester in 73 ?L of DMSO before use.  4.5.2 Wrap all reaction tubes with foil and keep covered as much as  possible in order to prevent photobleaching of the dyes.   Note: Dye esters must either be used immediately or aliquotted and  stored at -80oC.  Any introduced water to the dye esters will result  in a lower coupling efficiency due to the hydrolysis of the dye  esters.  Since DMSO is hygroscopic (absorbs water from the  atmosphere) store it well sealed in desiccant.    5. PROCEDURE  5.1 Aminoallyl Labeling  5.1.1 To 10 ?g of total RNA (or 2 ?g poly(A+) RNA) which has been  DNase I-treated and Qiagen RNeasy purified, add 2 ?L Random  Hexamer primers (3mg/mL) and bring the final volume up to 18.5  ?L with RNase-free water.  5.1.2 Mix well and incubate at 70oC for 10 minutes.  5.1.3 Snap-freeze in dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 seconds, centrifuge  briefly at >10,000 rpm and continue at room temperature.  5.1.4 Add:  5X First Strand buffer .. 6 ?L 0.1 M  DTT  .. 3 ?L 50X aminoallyl-dNTP mix .. 0.6 ?L SuperScript II RT (200U/?L) .. 2 ?L 5.1.5 Mix and incubate at 42oC for 3 hours to overnight.  5.1.6 To hydrolyze RNA, add:   1 M  NaOH    10 ?L  0.5 M  EDTA   10 ?L   mix and incubate at 65oC for 15 minutes.  5.1.7 Add 10 ?L of 1 M HCl to neutralize pH.  (Alternatively, one can  add 25 ?L 1 M HEPES pH 7.0 or 25 ?L 1 M Tris pH 7.4)   5.2 Reaction Purification I:  Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free  amines (use either the Qiagen or the Microcon method)   Qiagen Cleanup Method:  Note: This purification protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick  PCR purification kit protocol.  The phosphate wash and elution  buffers (prepared in 4.1.3 and 4.1.4) are substituted for the Qiagen  supplied buffers because the Qiagen buffers contain free amines  which compete with the Cy dye coupling reaction.  5.2.1 Mix cDNA reaction with 300 ?L (5X reaction volume) buffer PB  (Qiagen supplied) and transfer to QIAquick column.  5.2.2 Place the column in a 2 ml collection tube (Qiagen supplied) and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.2.3 To wash, add 750 ?L phosphate wash buffer to the column and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.4 Empty the collection tube and repeat the wash and centrifugation  step (5.2.3).   5.2.5 Empty the collection tube and centrifuge column an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.  5.2.6 Transfer column to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L phosphate elution buffer (see 4.1.4) to the center of the  column membrane.  5.2.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.2.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.2.6-  5.2.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  5.2.10 Dry sample in a speed vac.  or~ Microcon YM-30 Cleanup Method:  5.2.1 Place the Microcon sample reservoir into a collection microfuge  tube.  Add 375 ?L of water to the cDNA reaction tube and then  pipette the sample into the Microcon sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube without touching the membrane.  5.2.2 Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 min.   Note: Never centrifuge column to dryness as this will decrease product  recovery.  Adjust spin time to allow for optimal filtration while  allowing enough solution to remain for sufficient recovery.  5.2.3 Empty collection microfuge tube.  5.2.4 To wash add 450 ?L of water to the sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 minutes.    5.2.5 Empty collection microfuge tube and repeat previous wash step.  5.2.6 Invert Microcon sample reservoir into a new collection microfuge  tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute to collect purified  sample.  5.2.7 Dry the sample in a speed vac.    5.3 Coupling aa-cDNA to Cy Dye Ester.  5.3.1 Resuspend aminoallyl-labeled cDNA in 4.5 ?L 0.1 M sodium  carbonate buffer (Na2CO3), pH 9.0.  Note: Carbonate buffer changes composition over time so make sure you  make it fresh every couple of weeks to a month.  5.3.2 Add 4.5 ?L of the appropriate NHS-ester Cy dye (prepared in  DMSO: see 4.5)  Note: To prevent photobleaching of the Cy dyes wrap all reaction tubes  in foil and keep them sequestered from light as much as possible.   5.3.3 Incubate the reaction for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.  5.4 Reaction Purification II:  Removal of uncoupled dye (Qiagen PCR  Purification Kit)  5.4.1 To the reaction add 35 ?L 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2.  5.4.2 Add 250 ?L (5X reaction volume) Buffer PB (Qiagen supplied).  5.4.3 Place a QIAquick spin column in a 2 mL collection tube (Qiagen  supplied), apply the sample to the column, and centrifuge at  ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.4.4 To wash, add 0.75 mL Buffer PE (Qiagen supplied) to the column  and centrifuge at ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Note: Make sure Buffer PE has added ethanol before using (see label for  correct volume).  5.4.5 Empty collection tube and centrifuge column for an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.   5.4.6 Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L Buffer EB (Qiagen supplied) to the center of the column  membrane.  5.4.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.4.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.4.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.4.6-  5.4.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  Note: This protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick Spin  Handbook (04/2000, pg. 18).  5.5 Analysis of Labeling Reaction  5.5.1 Use a 50 ?L Beckman quartz MicroCuvette to analyze the entire  undiluted sample in a spectrophotometer.  5.5.2 Wash the cuvette with water and blow dry with compressed air  duster.  5.5.3 Pipette sample into cuvette and place cuvette in spectrophotometer.  5.5.4 For each sample measure absorbance at 260 nm and either 550 nm  for Cy3 or 650 nm for Cy5, as appropriate.  5.5.5 Pipette sample from cuvette back into the original sample tube.  5.5.6 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of cDNA synthesized  using:   pmol nucleotides = [OD260 * volume (uL) * 37 ng/?L * 1000 pg/ng]      324.5 pg/pmol  Note: 1 OD260 = 37 ng/?L for cDNA; 324.5 pg/pmol average molecular  weight of a dNTP) 5.5.7 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of dye incorporation  (Cy3 or Cy5 accordingly) using:  pmol Cy3  = OD550 * volume (?L)    0.15  pmol Cy5 = OD650 * volume (?L)    0.25  nucleotides/dye ratio =     pmol cDNA                  pmol Cy dye  Note:   >200 pmol of dye incorporation per sample and a ratio of less than  50 nucleotides/dye molecules is optimal for hybridizations (see  Microarray Cookbook II)   5.5.8 After analysis mix together the two differentially labeled probes  (Cy3 vs. Cy5) which will be hybridized to the same microarray  slide.  5.5.9 Dry the Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture to completion in a speed vac and  continue with SOP: M005 for the hybridization of the probe to a  microarray slide.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Cardiovascular disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The TIGR rodent expression web-based resource (TREX) contains over 2,200 microarray hybridizations, involving over 800 animals from 18 different rat strains. These strains comprise genetically diverse parental animals and a panel of chromosomal substitution strains derived by introgressing individual chromosomes from normotensive Brown Norway (BN/NHsdMcwi) rats into the background of Dahl salt sensitive (SS/JrHsdMcwi) rats. The profiles document gene-expression changes in both genders, four tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney) and two environmental conditions (normoxia, hypoxia). This translates into almost 400 high-quality direct comparisons (not including replicates) and over 100,000 pairwise comparisons. As each individual chromosomal substitution strain represents on average less than a 5% change from the parental genome, consomic strains provide a useful mechanism to dissect complex traits and identify causative genes. We performed a variety of data-mining manipulations on the profiles and used complementary physiological data from the PhysGen resource to demonstrate how TREX can be used by the cardiovascular community for hypothesis generation.</field>

      <name>The effect of MPO inhibitor on the gene expression profiles in HL-60 cell lines exposed to 1, 2, 4,-benzenetriol</name>
      <description>To reveal the gene expression profile changes after exposure to BT, one of benzene metabolites, with or without ABAH, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor, and to elucidate how MPO is involved in myelotoxicity of BT, we performed microarray analysis. HL-60 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 containing with 10% of heat-inactivated FBS at 4×10^5/ mL were incubated with or without BT (50 μM) at 37℃ for one or 4 hours. For MPO inhibition experiment, HL-60 (4×10^5 cells/ mL) were pretreatment with 100 μM of ABAH in RPMI 1640/10% of heat-inactivated FBS at 37℃ for 24 hours. Media was then replaced with new media containing the regent plus BT (50 μM) and incubate at 37℃ for one or 4 hours. Unexposed HL-60 cells were used as controls. To validate the microarray results, we selected 22 genes and conducted a real-time PCR. Gene expression alteration induced by 50 μM of BT in HL-60 cells, with or without ABAH, was measured at 1 and 4 hours after exposure to it. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (1 or 4 hours).</description>

      <name>Transcriptome analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to physical plasma treatment</name>
      <description>In this study, we introduce for the first time a growth chamber system suitable for physical plasma treatment of bacteria in liquid medium. Bacillus subtilis 168 cells were treated with argon plasma in order to investigate their specific stress response usong a proteomic and transcriptomic approach. The treatment with three different discharge voltages revealed not only growth differences, but also clear cellular stress responses. B. subtilis faces severe cell wall stress, which was made visible alsoelectron microscopy, DNA damages and oxidative stress. The biological findings could be supported by the reactive plasma species, found by plasma diagnostics, i.e. optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Cells were grown in LB medium. At OD540 of 0.5, argon plasma treatment was set for 15 min with a discharge power of 5 W. Samples for mircroarray analysis were taken 5 min after the 15 min plasma treatment. Microarray hybridizations were performed with RNA from three biological replicates. The individual samples were labeled with Cy5; a reference pool containing equal amounts of RNA from all samples was labeled with Cy3.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - The Bacillus subtilis 168 wild type strain was grown aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium.
 Sample Processing - At OD540 of 0.5, cells were treated with argon gas and argon plasma (with a discharge power of 5 W), respectively, for 15 min. Samples were taken 5 min after the treatment.
 Hybridization - 500 ng of Cy5-labeled cDNA and 500 ng of Cy3-labeled cDNA were hybridized to the microarray following Agilent’s hybridization, washing and scanning protocol (Two-Color Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis, version 5.5).
 Labeling - For cDNA synthesis, 10 µg of total RNA were mixed with random primers (Promega) and spike-ins (Two-Color RNA Spike-In Kit, Agilent Technologies). The RNA/primer mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min followed by 5 min incubation on ice. Then, the following reagents were added: 10 µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 5 µl of 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen), 0.5 µl of a dNTP mix (10 mM dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 mM dCTP), 1.25 µl of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) and 2µl of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min and then heated to 70 °C for 10 min. After 5 min on ice, the RNA was degraded by incubation with 2 units of RNaseH (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. Labeled cDNA was then purified using the CyScribe GFX Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). The individual samples were labeled with Cy5, whereas the reference pool was labeled with Cy3.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated by the mechanical cell disruption/ acid phenol method (Eymann et al., 2002, PMID: 11948165).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing sample/reference pool
 Feature Extraction - Data were extracted using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 10.5, Agilent Technologies).
 Image Adquisition - The microarray was scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner G2565CA (Agilent Technologies).</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Two weeks after node segmentation, they were transferred to soil in a growth chamber, and kept at 21 ±2 °C in the light and 18 ±1 °C in the dark, at a relative humidity of 75% ±2%, with 70-90 μmol/m2/s2 radiation (L36W/77 lamp, Osram, Germany) and a 16-h photoperiod
 Sample Treatment - After 4 weeks of growth in soil, the potato plants were inoculated with PVYNTN (isolate NIB-NTN, AJ585342) as described in [Plant Pathol 2010, 59:1121-1132]. For the mock-inoculated plants, the same procedures were performed with sap from healthy potato plants.
 Hybridization - Hybridization mixture was set up using Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies) and applied to the microarray. The hybridization at 65°C for 17 h was followed by washing with increasing stringency using Gene Expression Wash Buffers (Agilent) and drying with acetonitrile (SIGMA). All these steps were performed at IMGM Laboratories GmbH, Germany
 Labeling - 100 ng total RNA per sample were introduced into an RT-IVT reaction. Prior to RT-IVT, the total RNA samples were spiked with in-vitro synthesized polyadenylated transcripts (One-Color RNA Spike-In Mix, Agilent Technologies). The spiked total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and then converted into labeled cRNA by in-vitro transcription (Low Input Quick-Amp Labeling Kit One-Color, Agilent Technologies) incorporating Cyanine-3-CTP.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA from the inoculated leaves was extracted, treated, purified, and quality controlled as described previously (Baebler ret al., MPP, 2009)
 Scaning - Fluorescent signal intensities were detected with Scan Control A8.4.1 Software (Agilent Technologies) on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner and extracted from the images using Feature Extraction 10.7.3.1 Software (Agilent Technologies). All these steps were performed at IMGM Laboratories GmbH, Germany.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Data was analyzed in R environment with limma and Agi4x44PreProcess packages. Robust spline normalization was used (rsn), background was not subtracted. ID_REF =  VALUE = robust spline normalized log2 signal intensity</field>

      <name>H. pylori G27 HP0518 mutant showed greater motility</name>
      <description>Helicobacter pylori is a human gastric pathogen associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as specific gastric cancers. It is well-evidenced that motility is essential for this pathogen to colonize human gastric tissues. We found that the H. pylori G27 HP0518 mutant showed greater motility than the parental strain, leading to increased cell adhesion and subsequent CagA translocation and NF-κB activation in AGS cells. This mutant expressed a higher molecular mass flagellin A (FlaA) than the parental wild-type strain and the complemented HP0518 mutant, which correlated with differences in motility. Deglycosylation assays indicated that the increased molecular mass of the FlaA protein expressed by the mutant was due to O-linked glycoside modifications. Electron micrographs demonstrated that expression of bundle-formed flagellin filaments in the HP0518 mutant was enhanced in comparison to the wild-type strain. Different degrees of FlaA glycosylation between H. pylori strains suggested that glycosylation could affect both virulence and persistence in vivo. In conclusion, HP0518 inactivation resulted in FlaA hyper-glycosylation leading to increased virulence and motility. Microarray experiments were carried out as two-color hybridizations with a color-swap dye-reversal setting to compensate Cy-dye specific effects and to ensure statistically relevant data.</description>

 Feature Extraction - Data analysis was carried out on the Rosetta Inpharmics platform Resolver Version 7.0. Ratio profiles were combined in an error-weighted fashion with Resolver to create ratio experiments. A twofold change expression threshold for ratio experiments was applied together with anti-correlation of ratio profiles rendering the microarray analysis set highly significant (P-value &lt; 0.05), robust and reproducible.
 Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned with 10µm resolution using a  Agilent G2565AA scanner and default settings. Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1 and A.9.5 ) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file. Only the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Helicobacter pylori is a human gastric pathogen associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as gastric cancer. Mounting evidence suggests this pathogen's motility is prerequisite for successful colonization of human gastric tissues. Here, we isolated an H. pylori G27 HP0518 mutant exhibiting altered motility in comparison to its parental strain. We show that the mutant's modulated motility is linked to increased levels of O-linked glycosylation on flagellin A (FlaA) protein. Recombinant HP0518 protein decreased glycosylation levels of H. pylori flagellin in vitro, indicating that HP0518 functions in deglycosylation of FlaA protein. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analysis revealed increased glycosylation of HP0518 FlaA was due to a change in pseudaminic acid (Pse) levels on FlaA; HP0518 mutant-derived flagellin contained approximately threefold more Pse than the parental strain. Further phenotypic and molecular characterization demonstrated that the hyper-motile HP0518 mutant exhibits superior colonization capabilities and subsequently triggers enhanced CagA phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in AGS cells. Our study shows that HP0518 is involved in the deglycosylation of flagellin, thereby regulating pathogen motility. These findings corroborate the prominent function of H. pylori flagella in pathogen-host cell interactions and modulation of host cell responses, likely influencing the pathogenesis process.</field>

      <name>Identification of a novel insulin receptor-binding protein from Momordica charantia by transcriptomic, proteomic, and docking analyses</name>
      <description>Momordica charantia (MC) is a common vegetable in tropical areas and has been used for a long time as an alternative therapy for diabetes. Although several constituents of MC have displayed the hypoglycemic effects, the hypoglycemic targets of these constituents remain to be clarified. In this study, we analyzed and elucidated the therapeutic targets contributing to the hypoglycemic effect of aqueous extract of MC seeds (MCSE) by transcriptomic analysis. The protein ingredients aimed at the hypoglycemic target were further identified by proteomic, docking, and receptor-binding assays. Our data showed that MCSE, which was rich in small-molecular weight proteins, displayed hypoglycemic effects in normal and diabetic mice by glucose tolerance assay. MCSE significantly and primarily regulated the insulin signaling pathway in muscles and adipose tissues, suggesting that MCSE might target to insulin receptor (IR), stimulate the IR-downstream pathway, and subsequently display the hypoglycemic activity. We further identified that inhibitor against trypsin (TI) of MC directly docked into IR and activated the kinase activity of IR. In conclusion, our findings suggested that MCSE regulated glucose metabolism mainly via insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, we newly identified that TI was a novel IR-binding protein of MC that triggers the insulin signaling pathway via binding to IR. Mice were fasted for 4 h and MCSE or PBS was then orally given 15 min before intraperitoneal administration of glucose solution (1 g/kg body weight). Blood samples were collected from tails at 15 min before and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after glucose challenge. Blood glucose was measured by glucose oxidase method using a glucometer (ACCU-CHEK Advantage, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Mice were sacrificed 4 h after glucose challenge. Muscles, adipose tissues, and livers were collected for microarray analysis.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.</field>

      <name>Phosphate Starvation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</name>
      <description>Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient that is limiting in many environments. When P is scarce organisms employ strategies for conservation of internal stores, and to efficiently scavenge P from their external surroundings. In this study we investigated the acclimation response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to P deficiency, comparing the transcriptional profiles of P starved wild-type cells to the P replete condition. RNA was prepared from P-containing or P-deprived logarithmic growth phase cells and subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. During the 24 hours after the imposition of P starvation we observed that from the 407 significantly changing genes (> 2 fold change, corrected p-value &lt; 0.05) in the wild-type 317 genes were up-regulated, in average 8.36-fold, and 90 genes were down-regulated by 3.43-fold, in average. Many of the upregulated genes encoded enzymes involved in specific responses to P starvation, including PHOX, encoding the major secreted alkaline phosphatase, and multiple putative, high-efficiency phosphate transporter genes. More general responses included the up-regulation of genes involved in photoprotective processes (LHCSR3, LHCSR1, LHCBM9, PTOX1) and genes involved in protein modification and degradation. Down-regulated mRNAs indicated an early stage of the reduction of chloroplast ribosomal proteins, which are considered to be a reservoir for P in the cell. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain 21 gr (CC1690, wild-type) grown in TAP medium (Harris 1989) in a rotary incubator (200 rpm) at 25 °C in continuous light (70 µmol m-2 s-1). For 24 hours, either 1.1 mM phosphate or 0 mM were provided with the growth media. P deprivation was achieved by washing cells twice in midlogarithmic growth phase with liquid TAP medium without P (TAP-P) and cells were resuspended at a density of 2.5 mg/ml Chlorophyll in TAP or TAP-P. Cell aliquots were collected for mRNA isolation 24 h after being transferred either to TAP or TAP-P medium.</description>

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Illumina's proprietary software was used for basecalling. The reads were aligned using bowtie in single-end mode and with a maximum tolerance of 3 mismatches to the Au10.2 transcripts sequences (http://www.phytozome.net/chlamy), corresponding to the version 4.0 assembly of the Chlamydomonas genome. Expression estimates were obtained for each individual run in units of RPKMs (reads per kilobase of mappable transcript length per million mapped reads) after normalization by the number of aligned reads and transcript mappable length.

      <description>The main aim of the study was to compare genome-wide gene expression profiles obtained from the two widely used commercially available whole blood RNA collection systems - PAXgeneTM and TempusTM tubes. Comparisons of present call rates, variances, correlations and influence of globin reduction across the two collection systems was performed using in vivo glucocorticoid stimulation in 24 peripheral blood samples from three individuals. Three healthy male volunteers aged 30-35 years with body mass index of 20-25 were enrolled in the study.1.5 mg dexamethasone stimulated peripheral blood samples were drawn 3 hours later. For each sample, duplicate measures of 2.5 ml and 3ml blood was collected in PAXgeneTM tubes (PreAnalytiX GmbH, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and TempusTM tubes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) respectively. The PAXgeneTM and TempusTM tubes were stored for 2.5 hours at room temperature and then transferred to -20°C. Due to the lower RNA yield from the PAXgeneTM tubes, RNA from two PAXgeneTM tubes was pooled together for the experiment . Total RNA was isolated from whole blood stored in PAXgeneTM and TempusTM tubes according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. The PAXgeneTM samples were processed using the PAXgeneTM Blood RNA Kit based on the Quiagen method for column purification of nucleic acids (PreAnalytiX GmbH, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland, catalogue number 762174). The TempusTM samples were isolated using the TempusTM Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA, catalogue number 4380204). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The concentration and purity of total RNA was independently assessed by 260/280 UV absorption ratios, respectively (Nanophotometer, Implen, Munich, Germany). RNA samples were divided into non-globin reduced and globin reduced groups. The GLOBINclearTM-Human Kit (Ambion, Inc., Texas, USA, catalogue number #AM1980) was used to remove globin mRNA. Sample amplification and labeling for both globin-reduced and non-reduced samples was performed using the IlluminaR TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Inc., Texas, USA, catalogue number AMIL1791). RNA quality, yield and numbers of detected transcripts from the two RNA collection systems was comparable, with no significant differences between the tube types. Globin reduction resulted in a significant increase in present call rates in PAXgeneTM and TempusTM tubes and significant decrease in gene expression variance in both RNA collection tubes . Comparisons of glucocorticoid receptor-stimulated gene expression profiles between the two collection tube systems revealed an overlap of only 17 to 54%, depending on the stringency level of the statistical thresholds. This overlap increased by 1-8% when the RNA samples were processed to remove the globin mRNA. These results indicate that gene expression profiles obtained from PAXgeneTM and TempusTM differ drastically and should not be analyzed together. These data suggest that researchers must exert caution while interpreting expression profiles obtained through different RNA collection tubes.</description>

 Feature Extraction - Microarray expression analysis was performed in R, using beadarray (providing routines to handle Illumina BeadStudio data) , limma (for statistical routines) and vsn (for normalization) packages. Raw microarray scan files were exported using the Illumina Beadstudio program and loaded into R for downstream analysis. The data were transformed and normalized using the variance stabilizing normalization method. Of the 48804 probes present on the Human HT-12v3, probes were selected which fulfilled the criteria of Illumina probe detection p-value of &lt;0.01 in the individuals leaving 8203 transcripts after normalization and filtering for analysis. Raw qPCR data from the Roche LightCycler 480 System was extracted and the crossing thresholds (CT) from the technical replicates were averaged across all samples. Transcripts were normalized to housekeeping gene TBP.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Many soft tissue tumors recapitulate features of normal connective tissue. We hypothesize that different types of fibroblastic tumors are representative of different populations of fibroblastic cells or different activation states of these cells. We examined two tumors with fibroblastic features, solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF), by DNA microarray analysis and found that they have very different expression profiles, including significant differences in their patterns of expression of extracellular matrix genes and growth factors. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray, we found that genes specific for these two tumors have mutually specific expression in the stroma of nonneoplastic tissues. We defined a set of 786 gene spots whose pattern of expression distinguishes SFT from DTF. In an analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data from 295 previously published breast carcinomas, we found that expression of this gene set defined two groups of breast carcinomas with significant differences in overall survival. One of the groups had a favorable outcome and was defined by the expression of DTF genes. The other group of tumors had a poor prognosis and showed variable expression of genes enriched for SFT type. Our findings suggest that the host stromal response varies significantly among carcinomas and that gene expression patterns characteristic of soft tissue tumors can be used to discover new markers for normal connective tissue cells.</field>

      <name>Comparison of miRNA expression in HT29-tsp53 cells cultured at the permissive and restrictive temperatures</name>
      <description>The p53 tumour suppressor is a transcription factor that can regulate the expression of numerous genes encoding either proteins or microRNAs (miRNAs).  The predominant outcomes of a typical p53 response are the initiation of apoptotic cascades and the activation of cell cycle checkpoints.  HT29-tsp53 cells express a temperature sensitive variant of p53 and in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, these cells preferentially undergo G1 phase cell cycle arrest at the permissive temperature that correlates with increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1.   Recent evidence also suggests that a variety of miRNAs can induce G1 arrest by inhibiting the expression of proteins like CDK4 and CDK6. Here we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify p53-regulated miRNAs that are induced in these cells undergoing G1 arrest.  At the permissive temperature, the expression of several miRNAs was increased through a combination of either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, miR-34a-5p, miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p were strongly induced and they reached levels comparable to that of reference miRNAs (miR-191 and miR-103).  Importantly, miR-34a-5p and miR-145-5p are known to silence the Cdk4 and/or Cdk6 G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks).  Surprisingly, there was no p53-dependent decrease in the expression of either of these G1 cdks.  To search for other potential targets of p53-regulated miRNAs, p53-downregulated mRNAs were identified through parallel microarray analysis of mRNA expression.  Once again, there was no clear effect of p53 on the repression of mRNAs under these conditions despite a remarkable increase in p53-induced mRNA expression.  Therefore, despite a strong p53 transcriptional response, there was no clear evidence that p53-responsive miRNA contributed to gene silencing.  Taken together, the changes in cell cycle distribution in this cell line at the permissive temperature is likely attributable to transcriptional upregulation of the CDKN1A mRNA and p21WAF1 protein and not to the down regulation of CDK4 or CDK6 by p53-regulated miRNAs. Two independent experiments were performed with 2 samples in each experiment (1 control and 1 treatment condition).  In the control sample, RNA was isolated cells maintained at the restrictive temperature (37˚C). The treatment treated sample, was incubated for 16 hours at the permissive temperature  (32˚C).</description>

 Labeling - 500 ng of total RNA was labeled using Low RNA Input Fluor Linear Amp Kit PLUS (Agilent).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was purified using Tri reagent (Ambion) and RNA quality was determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).
 Scaning - Scanned on an Agilent scanner. Images were processed with Agilent Feature Extraction Software v10.1.1.1.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Linear LOWESS normalization was used. Default Agilent normalization was employed within Genespring GX. In detail, Each gene's measured intensity was divided by its control channel value in each sample; if the control channel was below 0 then 0 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 0 then no data was reported.  Each measurement was divided by the 50.0th percentile of all measurements in that sample.   The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present.    Each gene was divided by the median of its measurements in all samples. If the median of the raw values was below 0 then each measurement for that gene was divided by 0 if the numerator was above 0, otherwise the measurement was thrown out. ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized, log2 ratio of cy5/cy3. All values in matrix met Agilent spot quality filters in all arrays.</field>

      <name>PHK Cells: control vs. cyclosporine vs. 11R-VIVIT</name>
      <description>Calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway has been shown to play important roles in various tissues such as the immune system, cardiac muscle and neuron. Although recent studies have shown that the pathway is involved in the regulation of hair growth, the precise mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we examine the molecular mechanism which is regulated by calcineurin/NFAT pathway, using two specific inhibitors for the pathway. Transcriptional profiling of human keratinocyte cell line, PHK cells, comparing control untreated PHK cells with cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated or 11R-VIVIT-treated PHK cells. Goal was to identify the effects of NFAT inhibitors on PHK cell proliferation. Cyclosporine A is a chemical compound, which strongly inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity cooperating with cyclophilin, resulting in inhibition of NFAT signaling pathway.  11R-VIVIT is a cell-permeable peptide, which specifically interacts with NFAT and inhibits its binding to calcineurin, resulting in competitive inhibition of NFAT signaling pathway. Three-condition experiment; untreated PHK cells, CsA-treated PHK cells and 11R-VIVIT-treated PHK cells. Supplementary files: Significantly up-regulated genes across 4 different comparisons.</description>

      <name>Genome-wide identification of Ago2 binding sites from mouse embryonic stem cells with and without mature microRNAs</name>
      <description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of 19-22nt non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate their mRNA targets. Computational algorithms predict that over half of all genes are regulated by miRNAs, yet approaches for experimental identification of miRNA binding sites are now emerging.  To directly identify endogenous miRNA binding sites, we performed photo-crosslinking immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Ago2, followed by deep-sequencing of RNA tags (CLIP-seq) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We also performed parallel CLIP-seq in Dicer null mESCs that lack mature miRNAs, allowing us to define whether the association of Ago2 with the identified sites was mediated by miRNAs. We include the exon-array expression data obtained from three sets of Dicer WT and Dicer Null mESCs.These data are used to determine genes that are differentially expressed between Dicer WT and Dicer Null conditions. Six samples (3 Dicer wild-type CLIP RNA libraries representing two biological replicates, 2 Dicer null CLIP RNA libraries, 1 short-RNA library from Dicer wild-type mESCs) were analyzed. Six total mESC samples were analyzed (3 Dicer WT, 3 Dicer Null). Expression values for probesets were summarized into a single per-gene value. The log fold change for Dicer_WT/Dicer_Null was defined as the difference between the mean expression in Dicer WT mESCs and the mean expression in the Dicer Null mESCs.</description>

We have identified endogenous miRNA binding sites in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), by performing photo-cross-linking immunoprecipitation using antibodies to Argonaute (Ago2) followed by deep sequencing of RNAs (CLIP-seq). We also performed CLIP-seq in Dicer⁻/⁻ mESCs that lack mature miRNAs, allowing us to define whether the association of Ago2 with the identified sites was miRNA dependent. A significantly enriched motif, GCACUU, was identified only in wild-type mESCs in 3' untranslated and coding regions. This motif matches the seed of a miRNA family that constitutes ~68% of the mESC miRNA population. Unexpectedly, a G-rich motif was enriched in sequences cross-linked to Ago2 in both the presence and absence of miRNAs. Expression analysis and reporter assays confirmed that the seed-related motif confers miRNA-directed regulation on host mRNAs and that the G-rich motif can modulate this regulation.</field>

      <name>Exome sequencing and genome-wide copy number variant mapping reveal novel associations with sensorineural hereditary hearing loss</name>
      <description>Background The genetic diversity of loci and mutations underlying hereditary hearing loss is an active area of investigation. To identify loci associated with predominantly non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, we performed exome sequencing of families and of single probands, as well as copy number variation (CNV) mapping in a case-control cohort.  Results Analysis of three distinct families revealed several candidate loci in two families and a single strong candidate gene, MYH7B, for hearing loss in one family. MYH7B encodes a Type II myosin, consistent with a role for cytoskeletal proteins in hearing. High-resolution genome-wide CNV analysis of 150 cases and 157 controls revealed deletions in genes known to be involved in hearing (e.g. GJB6, OTOA, and STRC, encoding connexin 30, otoancorin, and stereocilin, respectively), supporting CNV contributions to hearing loss phenotypes. Additionally, a novel region on chromosome 16 containing part of the PDXDC1 gene was found to be frequently deleted in hearing loss patients (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.62-9.40, p = 1.45 x 10-7). Conclusions We conclude that many known as well as novel loci and distinct types of mutations not typically tested in clinical settings can contribute to the etiology of hearing loss. Our study also demonstrates the challenges of exome sequencing and genome-wide CNV mapping for direct clinical application, and illustrates the need for functional and clinical follow-up as well as curated open-access databases. Single replicates of 151 non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss cases and 157 controls with normal hearing were analyzed.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">To understand how sulphate-reducing bacteria respond to oxidative stresses, the responses of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough to H(2)O(2)-induced stresses were investigated with transcriptomic, proteomic and genetic approaches. H(2)O(2) and induced chemical species (e.g. polysulfide, ROS) and redox potential shift increased the expressions of the genes involved in detoxification, thioredoxin-dependent reduction system, protein and DNA repair, and decreased those involved in sulfate reduction, lactate oxidation and protein synthesis. A gene coexpression network analysis revealed complicated network interactions among differentially expressed genes, and suggested possible importance of several hypothetical genes in H(2)O(2) stress. Also, most of the genes in PerR and Fur regulons were highly induced, and the abundance of a Fur regulon protein increased. Mutant analysis suggested that PerR and Fur are functionally overlapped in response to stresses induced by H(2)O(2) and reaction products, and the upregulation of thioredoxin-dependent reduction genes was independent of PerR or Fur. It appears that induction of those stress response genes could contribute to the increased resistance of deletion mutants to H(2)O(2)-induced stresses. In addition, a conceptual cellular model of D. vulgaris responses to H(2)O(2) stress was constructed to illustrate that this bacterium may employ a complicated molecular mechanism to defend against the H(2)O(2)-induced stresses.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human mesenchymal stem cells from two different ages of individuals and grown at different oxygen levels</name>
      <description>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are found in many adult tissues. It is generally accepted that this type of stem cell forms different types of progenitor cells, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. There have been also reports about these cells differentiating into cardiac myocytes and neurons.  We found primary MSC enriched at the surface of spongious bone. Therefore cellular and environmentally-induced aging of MSC and their response to oxygen tension have been determined. Low oxygen levels appeared to be instructive on the stemness of MSC allowing proliferation upon stimulation while being protective with respect to differentiation and moreover low oxygen provided a milieu for extended cellular life span. Our data are furthermore indicative for cellular senescence eventually taking place in aged MSC, which however appears to complete more rapidly under mild oxidative stress.</description>

 Sample Processing - Low oxygen MSC culture: all incubation steps during isolation and expansion of cells (see human MSC growth condition protocol) were performed at 3% O2, 5% CO2, 37
 Hybridization - (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
 Labeling - RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Protocol (QIAGEN, Clifton Hill, Australia) and the quality of the RNA was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) where spectrophotometric analysis was carried out to determine the A260 to A280 ratio and the concentration. For qRT-PCR, cDNA synthesis was carried out using the Biorad (Perth) iScript cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturers instructions. For arrays, the cRNA was prepared from 3 ug of total RNA almost exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. &lt;br
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was isolated by homogenisation of the cells in 4.2 M guanidinium thiocyanate followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987).  The resulting total RNA was further purified by lithium chloride precipitation(final LiCl concentration 4.5 M).</field>

      <name>Insight into Vibrio parahaemolyticus CHN25 response to artificial gastric fluid stress by transcriptomic analysis</name>
      <description>Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the causative agent of food-borne gastroenteritis disease. Once consumed, human acid gastric fluid is perhaps one of the most important environmental stresses imposed on the bacterium. Herein, for the first time, we investigated Vibrio parahaemolyticus CHN25 response to artificial gastric fluid (AGF) stress by transcriptomic analysis. The bacterium at logarithmic growth phase (LGP) displayed lower survival rates than that at stationary growth phase (SGP) under a sub-lethal acid condition (pH 4.9). Transcriptome data revealed that 11.6% of the expressed genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus CHN25 was up-regulated in LGP cells after exposed to AGF (pH 4.9) for 30 min, including those involved in sugar transport, nitrogen metabolism, energy production and protein biosynthesis, whereas 14.0% of the genes was down-regulated, such as ABC transporter and flagellar biosynthesis genes. In contrast, the AGF stress only elicited 3.4% of the genes from SGP cells, the majority of which were attenuated in expression. Moreover, the number of expressed regulator genes was also substantially reduced in SGP cells. Comparison of transcriptome profiles further revealed forty-one growth-phase independent genes in the AGF stress, however, half of which displayed distinct expression features between the two growth phases. Vibrio parahaemolyticus seemed to have evolved a number of molecular strategies for coping with the acid stress. The data here will facilitate future studies for environmental stresses and pathogenicity of the leading food-borne pathogen worldwide. When V.parahemolyticus CHN25 grown to log phase and stationary phase at 37°C in TSB-3% NaCl, different cultures were subsequently exposed to artificial gastric fluid at 37°C for 30 min. Two independent experiments were performed at each phase for microarray expreriments.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Vibrio parahaemolyticus CHN25 was streaked from frozen stocks (stored at -80°C) onto LB (pH 8.5) agar and stored at 4°C for working stocks. For acid survival and microarray studies, one colony from the working stock was inoculated into 5 ml Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, pH 8.5) supplemented with 3% NaCl (TSB-3% NaCl) and grown at 37°C overnight (12 to 18 h). The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 5 ml fresh TSB-3% NaCl shaking at 175 rpm at 37°C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600nm) of 0.7 and 1.3
 Sample Treatment - Briefly, a 1 ml aliquot of culture was centrifuged with 3500 rpm for 2 min, then it was resuspended using 1 ml artificial gastric fluid, and added to 4 ml artificial gastric fluid (8.3 g/liter Proteose peptone, 3.5 g D-glucose, 2.05 g NaCl, 0.6 g KH2PO4, 0.147 g CaCl2•2H2O, 0.37 g KCl, adjusted to pH 4.9 with HCl). Acid-exposed cultures at log phase or stationary phase were subsequently incubated at 37°C for 30 min time.
 Hybridization - Each Slide was hybridized with 600ng Cy3-labeled cRNA using Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Cat#5188-5242, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) in Hybridization Oven (Cat#G2545A, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 17 hours hybridization, slides were washed in staining dishes (Cat#121, Thermo Shandon, Waltham, MA, US) with Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit(Cat#5188-5327, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), followed the manufacturer’s instructions。
 Labeling - Total RNA was amplified and labeled by Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, One-Color (Cat#5190-2305, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled cRNA were purified by RNeasy mini kit (Cat#74106, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Protect bacterial mini kit 74524(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and checked for a RIN number to inspect RNA integration by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).Qualified total RNA was further purified by RNeasy mini kit (Cat#74106, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany) and RNase-Free DNase Set (Cat#79254, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany).
 Scaning - Slides were scanned by Agilent Microarray Scanner (Cat#G2565CA, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) with default settings, Dye channel: Green, Scan resolution=5μm, photoelectric multiplication tube (PMT) 100%, 10%, 16bit. Data were extracted with Feature Extraction software 10.7 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US).</field>

      <name>A Model System for Studying the Transcriptomic and Physiological Changes Associated with Mammalian Host-Adaptation by Leptospira interrogans Serovar Copenhageni</name>
      <description>Leptospirosis, an emerging zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution, is caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. More than 500,000 cases of severe leptospirosis are reported annually, with .10% of these being fatal. Leptospires can survive for weeks in suitably moist conditions before encountering a new host. Reservoir hosts, typically rodents, exhibit little to no signs of disease but shed large numbers of organisms in their urine. Transmission occurs when mucosal surfaces or abraded skin come into contact with infected urine or urine-contaminated water or soil. In humans, leptospires can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild fever to severe icteric (Weil’s) disease and pulmonary haemorrhage. Currently, little is known about how Leptospira persist within a reservoir host. Prior in vitro studies have suggested that leptospires alter their transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in response to environmental signals encountered during mammalian infection. However, no study has examined gene expression by leptospires within a mammalian host-adapted state. To obtain a more faithful representation of how leptospires respond to host-derived signals, we used RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of L. interrogans cultivated within dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted into the peritoneal cavities of rats with that of organisms grown in vitro. In addition to determining the relative expression levels of ‘‘core’’ housekeeping genes under both growth conditions, we identified 166 genes that are differentially-expressed by L. interrogans in vivo. Our analyses highlight physiological aspects of host adaptation by leptospires relating to heme uptake and utilization. We also identified 11 novel non-coding transcripts that are candidate small regulatory RNAs. The DMC model provides a facile system for studying the transcriptional and antigenic changes associated with mammalian host-adaption, selection of targets for mutagenesis, and the identification of previously unrecognized virulence determinants. Transcriptome analysis of L. interrogans Copenhageni FIOCRUZ L1-130 using RNA from 2 different conditions using RNA-seq. Also, the reproducibility and robustness of data is ensured by three biological replicates from each condition.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Virulent low-passage Leptospira interrogans sv. Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 was cultivated in vitro under standard conditions at 30C in EMJH medium supplemented with 1% rabbit serum (Pel-514 Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) with 100 μg/ml 5-fluorouracil. To obtain L. interrogans in a mammalian host-adapted state, leptospires were cultivated in dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs). Briefly, DMCs were constructed using standard dialysis membrane tubing (Spectra-Por; 8000 MW cut-off). Prior to use, 8-inch strips of dialysis tubing were tied off at one end and then sterilized by boiling for 20 min in sterile water containing 5 mM EDTA, followed by two successive boiling washes in water alone. Dialysis bags were cooled to room temperature and then filled with ~8-9 mls of EMJH medium (supplemented with 10% vaccine-grade bovine serum albumin to maintain osmotic pressure) containing 10^4 organisms per ml. Once filled, the tubing was tied and excess membrane removed from both ends. For implantation, female Sprague-Dawley rats (150-174 g) were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg), and acepromazine (1 mg/kg). Using strict aseptic technique, a DMC was implanted into the peritoneal cavity of each rat. Analgesia (carprofen; 5 mg/kg) was administered on the day of surgery and once the following day. At designated time points (typically 9-10 days postimplantation), rats were euthanized by CO2 narcosis and DMCs recovered. The contents of each chamber were removed by gentle syringe aspiration with an 18G needle; the needle was removed prior to expelling the DMC dialysate into a sterile 15 ml conical bottom tube. Bacteria were enumerated by dark field microscopy immediately following explant using a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber (Hausser Scientific Co., Horsham, PA).
 Library Construction - Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and digested with DNase I One hundred ng of total RNA was used for library generation according to Illumina standard protocols (TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide, Low-Throughput Protocol, Part # 15008136 Rev. A). cDNAs were normalized using a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) approach according to the DSN Normalization Sample Preparation Guide, Early Access Protocol, Part # 15014673 Rev. C, which decreases the prevalence of highly abundant transcripts, such as rRNAs.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Reads were de-multiplexed. Sequence reads were then mapped against the L. interrogans Copenhageni FIOCRUZ L1-130 reference genome using Segemehl with accuracy set to 100%. To increase mapping quality, unmapped reads were sequentially truncated by one nucleotide from the end of the read and were mapped again. This process was iterated until a minimal read length of 20 nucleotides or until a read mapped into a single location on the chromosome.

      <name>Oncogenic potential of RAS isoforms in melanocytes</name>
      <description>We compared the transformation efficiencies of mutant NRAS and KRAS in immortal, non-transformed Ink4a/Arf-deficient melanocytes. NRAS mutation leads to increased cellular proliferation and is potently tumorigenic. In contrast, KRAS mutation does not enhance melanocyte proliferation and is only weakly tumorigenic on its own. While both NRAS and KRAS activate MAPK signaling, only NRAS enhances MYC activity in these cells. Our data suggests that the activity of specific RAS isoforms is context dependent and provides a possible explanation for the prevalence of NRAS mutations in melanoma.In addition, understanding this mechanism will have important implications for cancer therapies targeting RAS pathways.

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">RAS genes are mutated in approximately 30% of all human cancers. Interestingly, there exists a strong bias in favor of mutation of only one of the three major RAS genes in tumors of different cellular origins. NRAS mutations occur in approximately 20% of human melanomas, whereas HRAS and KRAS mutations are rare in this disease. To define the mechanism(s) responsible for this preference in melanocytes, we compared the transformation efficiencies of mutant NRAS and KRAS in immortal, non-transformed Ink4a/Arf-deficient melanocytes. NRAS mutation leads to increased cellular proliferation and is potently tumorigenic. In contrast, KRAS mutation does not enhance melanocyte proliferation and is only weakly tumorigenic on its own. Although both NRAS and KRAS activate mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, only NRAS enhances MYC activity in these cells. Our data suggest that the activity of specific RAS isoforms is context-dependent and provide a possible explanation for the prevalence of NRAS mutations in melanoma. In addition, understanding this mechanism will have important implications for cancer therapies targeting RAS pathways.</field>

      <description>KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule.  KRAP-deficient (KRAP-/-) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia.  KRAP-/- mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia.  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from livers of three pairs of littermates (KO1 vs. WT1, KO2 vs. WT2 and KO3 vs. WT3) fed normal chow.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Obesity and related metabolic disorders have become leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality. KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule, however, its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that KRAP-deficient (KRAP(-/-)) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia. KRAP(-/-) mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. Notably, glucose uptake in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in KRAP(-/-) mice is enhanced in an insulin-independent manner, suggesting that BAT is involved in altered energy homeostasis in KRAP(-/-) mice, although UCP (Uncoupling protein) expressions are not altered. Of interest is the down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism-related molecules, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-1, ACC-2 and fatty acid synthase in the liver of KRAP(-/-) mice, which could in part account for the metabolic phenotype in KRAP(-/-) mice. Thus, KRAP is a novel regulator in whole-body energy homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in obesity and related diseases.</field>

      <name>A novel unusual chromosome 11 abnormality: a homozygous somatic deletion of the entire WT1 gene within a heterozygous 11p13 deletion and UPD limited to 11p15 in a Wilms tumor and establishment of an immortalized cell line</name>
      <description>We describe a stromal predominant Wilms tumor with a complex, tumor specific chromosome 11 aberration: a homozygous deletion of the entire WT1 gene within a heterozygous 11p13 deletion and an additional region of uniparental disomy (UPD) limited to 11p15.5-p15.2 including the IGF2 gene. The tumor carried a heterozygous p.T41A mutation in CTNNB1. Cells established from the tumor carried the same chromosome 11 aberration, but a different, homozygous p.S45Δ CTNNB1 mutation. Uniparental disomy (UPD) 3p21.3pter lead to the homozygous CTNNB1 mutation. The tumor cell line was immortalized with telomerase (TERT) and a novel triple ts mutant SV40 large T antigen (LT). This cell line is cytogenetically stable and can be grown indefinitely. It is a valuable tool to study the effect of a complete lack of WT1 in tumor cells. The tumor cell line and the immortalized cells have a limited potential for muscle/osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation similar to all other WT1 mutant cell lines.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Cells were cultivated in MCSG-medium (Lonza) at 37 degree and 5% CO2. Medium was changed every third day.
 Sample Treatment - Batch B: The cell culture of Wilsm10 was immortalized with telomerase (pBABE-hygro hTERT- from Addgene) and a triple mutant SV40 large T antigen (U19 del89-97tsA58). Both construct were transduced into Wilms10 cells using a retroviral virus. After transduction the cells were cultured in G418 (selection for T-antigene; 200µg/ml) for a week, followed with hygromycin (selection for telomerase; 20 µg/ml). In addition single cell clones were isolated and cultivated initially at 33 degree for maintenance of the temperature sensitive T-Antigene.
 Hybridization - 1.65 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity >10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 55 µl containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 55 µl of 2x GE hybridization buffer HI- RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (4x 44K) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent) and air dried.
 Labeling - Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.5 ug RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations, with an included on-column DNase digestion. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer and quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
 Scaning - Scanned on an Agilent G2505C scanner.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Scans were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (batch A: V10.7.1.1; batch B: V11.5.1.1) applying default parameters. Control spots were removed, replicate oligos averaged. Arrays were quantile normalized between chips using R-software (Limma). ID_REF =  VALUE = Quantile normalized signal intensity</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We describe a stromal predominant Wilms tumor with focal anaplasia and a complex, tumor specific chromosome 11 aberration: a homozygous deletion of the entire WT1 gene within a heterozygous 11p13 deletion and an additional region of uniparental disomy (UPD) limited to 11p15.5-p15.2 including the IGF2 gene. The tumor carried a heterozygous p.T41A mutation in CTNNB1. Cells established from the tumor carried the same chromosome 11 aberration, but a different, homozygous p.S45Δ CTNNB1 mutation. Uniparental disomy (UPD) 3p21.3pter lead to the homozygous CTNNB1 mutation. The tumor cell line was immortalized using the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) in conjunction with a novel thermolabile mutant (U19dl89-97tsA58) of SV40 large T antigen (LT). This cell line is cytogenetically stable and can be grown indefinitely representing a valuable tool to study the effect of a complete lack of WT1 in tumor cells. The origin/fate of Wilms tumors with WT1 mutations is currently poorly defined. Here we studied the expression of several genes expressed in early kidney development, e.g. FOXD1, PAX3, SIX1, OSR1, OSR2 and MEIS1 and show that these are expressed at similar levels in the parental and the immortalized Wilms10 cells. In addition the limited potential for muscle/ osteogenic/ adipogenic differentiation similar to all other WT1 mutant cell lines is also observed in the Wilms10 tumor cell line and this is retained in the immortalized cells. In summary these Wilms10 cells are a valuable model system for functional studies of WT1 mutant cells.</field>

      <description>The goal of this study was to identify brain cortex gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A) from SABiosciences. Mice used in this study were 2 week old males. Total RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates. For this study, cortical tissue from 3 mice of each genotype was used and RNA from the cortex of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.  The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Heterozygous MeCP2 A140V females produced in our mouse colony were bred with wild type male C57BL/6 mice to produce the male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous and wild type littermate mice used in these experiments. All breeding and experimentation was conducted in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.
 Sample Treatment - no treatment
 Hybridization - n/a
 Labeling - PCR assays were performed using the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A) from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed from 1 µg total RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SA Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR using the cDNA was then performed on an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine using this protocol: 10 minutes at 95ºC followed by 40 cycles of (95ºC for 15 seconds, 55ºC for 40 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mice and their male wild type littermates (n=3 for each group). TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used to extract the RNA from homogenized brain tissue. RNA was then purified using the SA Biosciences (Frederick, Maryland) RT2 qPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit. Turbo DNA-free from Ambion (Austin, Texas) was used to remove residual genomic DNA from the samples. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA for each sample using SA Biosciences RT2 First-Strand Kit.
 Scaning - n/a</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Experiments used an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine. Ct thresholds were manually set within the linear phase of the logarithmic amplification plots using Opticon Monitor 3 software. Data from the logarithmic plots was exported and analyzed using the downloadable Excel PCR Array Data Analysis Template version 2.0 provided by SA Biosciences (http://sabiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php). This template uses the ΔΔCt method to establish the fold change between control and experimental groups. It also uses a two-tailed student’s t test to establish statistical significance using p&lt;0.05. A set of 5 housekeeping genes (Gapdh, Actb, HSP90ab1, Hprt1, and Gusb), which are included on the array plates, was used for normalization. This was done by subtracting the average Ct value of the housekeeping genes in each sample from the Ct values of the genes of interest in that sample. The 'non-normalized.txt' reports raw Ct values before normalization.

      <name>Transcriptome analysis of lungs from six different mouse strains after infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus [set 1]</name>
      <description>Susceptible (DBA/2J, 129/SvImJ,  A/J) and Resistant (SM/J, C57BL/6J, Balb/cJ) mouse strain were inoculated with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus (A/Hong Kong/213/2003) for 24 and 168 hours. Uninfected control animals were included. Differences in expression were analyzed and used to identify candidate genes and pathways that contributed to the difference in H5N1 pathogenesis in these two groups of mice. Female 6-8 weeks old animals were inoculated with H5N1 virus or not and 24 and 168 hours later the lungs were obtained and immediately homogenized in Trizol. The extracted RNA was submitted for Illumina Gene expression profiling.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The genotype of the host is one of several factors involved in the pathogenesis of an infectious disease and may be a key parameter in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection in humans. Gene polymorphisms may affect the viral replication rate or alter the host's immune response to the virus. In humans, it is unclear which aspect dictates the severity of H5N1 virus disease. To identify the mechanism underlying differential responses to H5N1 virus infection in a genetically diverse population, we assessed the host responses and lung viral loads in 21 inbred mouse strains upon intranasal inoculation with A/Hong Kong/213/03 (H5N1). Resistant mouse strains survived large inocula while susceptible strains succumbed to infection with 1,000- to 10,000-fold-lower doses. Quantitative analysis of the viral load after inoculation with an intermediate dose found significant associations with lethality as early as 2 days postinoculation, earlier than any other disease indicator. The increased viral titers in the highly susceptible strains mediated a hyperinflamed environment, indicated by the distinct expression profiles and increased production of inflammatory mediators on day 3. Supporting the hypothesis that viral load rather than an inappropriate response to the virus was the key severity-determining factor, we performed quantitative real-time PCR measuring the cytokine/viral RNA ratio. No significant differences between susceptible and resistant mouse strains were detected, confirming that it is the host genetic component controlling viral load, and therefore replication dynamics, that is primarily responsible for a host's susceptibility to a given H5N1 virus.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus has circulated in Southeast Asia since 2003 but has been confirmed in relatively few individuals. It has been postulated that host genetic polymorphisms increase the susceptibility to infection and severe disease. The mechanisms and host proteins affected during severe disease are unknown. Inbred mouse strains vary considerably in their ability to resist H5N1 virus and were used to identify the primary mechanism determining disease severity. After inoculation with H5N1, resistant mouse strains had reduced amounts of virus in their lungs, which subsequently resulted in lower production of proinflammatory mediators and less pathology. We therefore conclude that the host genetic component controlling disease severity is primarily influencing viral replication. This is an important concept, as it emphasizes the need to limit virus replication through antiviral therapies and it shows that the hyperinflammatory environment is simply a reflection of more viral genetic material inducing a response.</field>

      <name>The sRNA SorY confers resistance during photooxidative stress by affecting a metabolite transporter in Rhodobacter sphaeroides</name>
      <description>Exposure to oxygen and light generates photooxidative stress by the bacteriochlorophyll a mediated formation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in the facultative photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We have identified SorY as an sRNA, which is induced under several stress conditions and confers increased resistance against 1O2. SorY by direct interaction decreases the levels of takP mRNA, encoding a TRAP-T transporter. A takP mutant shows higher resistance to 1O2 than the wild type, which is no longer affected by SorY. We present a model in which SorY reduces the metabolite flux into the TCA cycle by reducing malate import through TakP. It was previously shown that oxidative stress in bacteria leads to switch from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate cycle and to reduced activity of the tricaboxylic acid cycle. As a consequence the production of the prooxidant NADH is reduced and production of the protective NADPH is enhanced. In R. sphaeroides enzymes for glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, Entner–Doudoroff pathway and gluconeogenesis are induced in response to 1O2 by the alternative sigma factor RpoHII. The same is true for the sRNA SorY. By limiting malate import SorY thus contributes to the balance of the metabolic fluxes under photooxidative stress conditions. This assigns a so far unknown function to an sRNA in oxidative stress response. RNA samples collected from a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the SorY overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 1O2 stress were analyzed by two-color microarrays</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - R. sphaeroides strains grown aerobically
 Sample Treatment - R. sphaeroides was grown aerobically. Photooxidative stress conditions were generated by the addition of methylene blue (0.2 µM) and exposure to white light (800wm-2) for 10min
 Hybridization - Total RNA of three independent experiments of a SorY overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) and a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) after 10 min of 1O2 stress, were pooled and hybridized to one array. Two arrays werehybridized with independent experimental runs. Gene chip hybridization and scanning were performed according to the specifications from Agilent.
 Labeling - The ULSTM Fluorescent Labeling Kit for Agilent arrays (Kreatech) was used for RNA labeling and fragmentation
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated by using the hot phenol method (Janzon et al., 1986). After DNase I treatment the RNA was purified by using mixtures of phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol and chloroform-isoamylacohol. For microarray analysis the RNA was further purified by RNeasy®MinElute™ spin columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
 Scaning - Scanned on an Agilent High Resolution Microarray Scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.7.5)</field>

      <name>Microarray analysis of iris gene expression in mice with mutations relevant to glaucoma</name>
      <description>Several ocular diseases involve the iris, notably including oculocutaneous albinism, pigment dispersion syndrome, and exfoliation syndrome. To screen for candidate genes that may be active in these diseases, genome-wide iris gene expression patterns were comparatively analyzed from mouse models of these conditions. Irides were obtained from healthy C57Bl/6J, B6-Lystbg-J/J which carry a mutation in the Lyst gene, B6(Cg)-TyrC-2J/J which carry a mutation in the tyr gene, and B6.D2-Tryp1bGpnmbR150X/Sj with mutations in both Tryp1 and Gpnmb.  Four eyes from two mice were pooled for one sample.  Three samples were prepared for each strain.</description>

To screen for candidate genes that may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases, genome-wide iris gene expression patterns were comparatively analyzed from mouse models of these conditions.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Iris samples from albino mice with a Tyr mutation, pigment dispersion-prone mice with Tyrp1 and Gpnmb mutations, and mice resembling exfoliation syndrome with a Lyst mutation were compared with samples from wild-type mice. All mice were strain (C57BL/6J), age (60 days old), and sex (female) matched. Microarrays were used to compare transcriptional profiles, and differentially expressed transcripts were described by functional annotation clustering using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to validate a subset of identified changes.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Compared with wild-type C57BL/6J mice, each disease context exhibited a large number of statistically significant changes in gene expression, including 685 transcripts differentially expressed in albino irides, 403 in pigment dispersion-prone irides, and 460 in exfoliative-like irides.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Functional annotation clusterings were particularly striking among the overrepresented genes, with albino and pigment dispersion-prone irides both exhibiting overall evidence of crystallin-mediated stress responses. Exfoliative-like irides from mice with a Lyst mutation showed overall evidence of involvement of genes that influence immune system processes, lytic vacuoles, and lysosomes. These findings have several biologically relevant implications, particularly with respect to secondary forms of glaucoma, and represent a useful resource as a hypothesis-generating dataset.</field>

      <name>Reciprocal transcriptional responses in the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and Tetranychus urticae.</name>
      <description>While pathogen-induced immunity is comparatively well characterized, far less is known about plant defense responses to arthropod herbivores. To date, most molecular-genetic studies of plant-arthropod interactions have focused on insects. However, plant-feeding (phytophagous) mites are also pests of diverse plants, and mites induce different patterns of damage to plant tissues than do well-studied insects (e.g., Lepidopteran larvae or aphids). The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is among the most significant mite pests in agriculture. T. urticae is an extreme generalist that has been documented on a staggering number of plant hosts (more than 1,100), and is renowned for the rapid evolution of pesticide resistance. To understand reciprocal interactions between T. urticae and a plant host at the molecular level, we examined mite herbivory using Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite differences in feeding guilds, we found that transcriptional responses of A. thaliana to mite herbivory generally resembled those observed for insect herbivores. In particular, defense to mites was mediated by jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling. Further, indole glucosinolates dramatically increased mite mortality and development times. Variation in both basal and activated levels of these defense pathways might also explain differences in mite damage and feeding success between A. thaliana accessions. On the herbivore side, a diverse set of genes associated with detoxification of xenobiotics was induced upon exposure to increasing levels of in planta indole glucosinolates. Our findings provide molecular insights into the nature of, and response to, herbivory for a representative of a major class of arthropod herbivores. We used microarray to assess global gene expresion in Arabidopsis thaliana upon Tetranychus urticae attack in two A. thaliana accessions: Bla-2, resistant to spider mite herbivory and Kon, susceptible to spider mite herbivory. 3 week old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were subjected to Tetranychus urticae attack through application of 10 mites for various periods of time (timecourse scenario) or hundreds of mites for 1 hour (feeding site scenario).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Worm_embryo_growth_and_harvest_v5. Embryos were prepared by bleaching from gravid N2 adults grown in standard S-basal media liquid culture. Live embryos were cross-linked in M9 + 2% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by quenching with 125mM glycine for 5 minutes. Embryos were then washed twice with M9 Buffer and once by FA buffer (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl). Pellets were frozen at -80C. For a detailed protocol see http://www.modencode.org/.
 Sample Processing - Worm_embryo_extraction_v2. Embryos were resuspended in FA buffer (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl) + protease inhibitors (Calbiochem Cat# 539131). Using a Branson sonifier microtip, samples were sonicated on ice at the following settings: 35% amplitude, 0.9 sec on, 0.1 sec off, 12 pulses, 10 times. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 13,000 g for 15 minutes at 4C and taking the supernatant. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford Assay and extracts were aliquoted at stored at -80C. For a detailed protocol see http://www.modencode.org/.
 Library Construction - Worm_chromatin_immunoprecipitation_vMBJ5. 2mg extract + 1%sarkosyl was used for each ChIP with 10% taken as input directly into elution buffer (1% SDS in TE, 250 mM NaCl) and treated with RNAse. Antibody (10 ug) was added to each IP sample and incubated overnight at 4C. Immune complexes were incubated (2hrs at 4C) with 25 ul packed volume of protein A sepharose (GE Healthcare), and washed with 1 mL of each of the following solutions: ChIP Buffer, ChIP Buffer+1M NaCl, ChIP Buffer+500mM NaCl, TEL Buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA), and 2X TE (10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA). Samples were eluted twice with 150uL elution buffer for 15minutes at 65C. Samples were treated with proteinase K at 55C for 1-2hrs then transfer to 65C overnight to reverse crosslinks. DNA was cleaned up Qiagen PCR purification kit. For a detailed protocol see http://www.modencode.org/. || Solexa_Library_Prep_vKI1. DNA was incubated with End Repair Enzyme mix (Epicentre, Madison) to ensure blunt ends and then with Exo(-) Klenow fragment in the presence of dATP to add adenosine at the 3\` ends. The DNA fragments were ligated with single-end adaptor (Illumina) and then amplified by PCR with single end primers. The amplicon was loaded into an agarose gel, and size-selected DNA was recovered from the gel.</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We determined the genomic regions associated with the nuclear transmembrane protein LEM-2 in mixed-stage C. elegans embryos via chromatin immunoprecipitation. Large regions of several megabases on the arms of each autosome were associated with LEM-2. The center of each autosome was mostly free of such interactions, suggesting that they are largely looped out from the nuclear membrane. Only the left end of the X chromosome was associated with the nuclear membrane. At a finer scale, the large membrane-associated domains consisted of smaller subdomains of LEM-2 associations. These subdomains were characterized by high repeat density, low gene density, high levels of H3K27 trimethylation, and silent genes. The subdomains were punctuated by gaps harboring highly active genes. A chromosome arm translocated to a chromosome center retained its association with LEM-2, although there was a slight decrease in association near the fusion point.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Although Caenorhabditis elegans was the first multicellular organism with a completely sequenced genome, how this genome is arranged within the nucleus is not known.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Local DNA or chromatin properties are the main determinant of interaction with the nuclear membrane, with position along the chromosome making a minor contribution. Genes in small gaps between LEM-2 associated regions tend to be highly expressed, suggesting that these small gaps are especially amenable to highly efficient transcription. Although our data are derived from an amalgamation of cell types in mixed-stage embryos, the results suggest a model for the spatial arrangement of C. elegans chromosomes within the nucleus.</field>

      <name>miRNA expression data from human myocardial infarction hearts</name>
      <description>Sexual dimorphisms are well recognized in various cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). MI develops later in women, but once established, it contributes more persistent symptoms and higher mortality than in men. Although mRNA-level sexual dimorphism of MI have been reported, whether miRNA transcriptome also confers such dimorphism remains unknown. Comprehensive understanding of the mRNA- and miRNA-level genetic programs underlying the heart sexual dimorphisms will expectedly improve clinical outcome by facilitating the development of gender specific treatment strategies. Here, by conducting miRNA microarray analysis of human MI samples, we set out to characterize the heart sexual dimorphisms at the level of miRNA transcriptome Human tissue samples, acquired during post-mortem examination and frozen in liquid nitrogen, were provided by the department of pathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital after the approval from the ethical committee. Age- and sex-matched cohorts were selected to compare healthy hearts to those with post-MI LV remodeling. Border zone for myocardial infarction was sampled. Total RNA was extracted using Sepasol solution (Sepasol-RNA I super G, nakalai tesque, Japan), and microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 Arrays</description>

      <name>Global transcriptome analysis identifies shade avoidance-related genes regulated by BBX24 in Arabidopsis thaliana</name>
      <description>In seedlings, the induction of shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) involves a rapid up-regulation for known shade marker genes and subsequently activates an interacting network of various hormones that will eventually lead to cell elongation. We found that the B-box protein AtBBX24 have positive effects on the SAS (positive regulators). Global expression analysis of col and bbx24 seedlings reveals that a large number of genes involved in hormonal signaling pathways are positively regulated by BBX24 in response to simulated shade. The microarray experiment consisted in a factorial design comprising two genotypes (col and bbx24-1) and two light treatments (white light and simulated shade).  RNA material was extracted from 7-day-old seedlings. Two replicates per treatment were performed using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips. RNA was prepared, labeled and hybridized in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized and genes with ‘absent’ calls and a signal of &lt;50 units in all replicate experiments were filtered out. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified by performing profile analysis using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; Tusher et al., 2001).</description>

      <description>A hESC MESP1-MCHERRY reporter line was used to isolate and study the molecular character of MESP1 expressing pre-cardiac progenitors, derived from hESC. MESP1 is a key-transcription factor for pre-cardiac mesoderm and is marking the progenitor for almost all cells of the heart. This reporter line was used to study cardiac differentiation and the derivation of early cardiac progenitors in vitro. hESCs were differentiated towards the cardiac lineage, expressing MESP1-mCherry at day 3 of differentiation. Total RNA obtained from isolated MESP1-mCherry expressing progenitors was compared to that of non-MESP1-expressing progenitors and undifferentiated hESCs in order to characterize MESP1-specific transcription factors and proteins.</description>

      <name>Increased hemoglobin expression in NASH livers</name>
      <description>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Recent studies revealed that hemoglobin is expressed in some non-erythrocytes and it suppresses oxidative stress when overexpressed. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study was to investigate whether hemoglobin is expressed in hepatocytes and how it is related to oxidative stress in NASH patients. METHODS: Microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in NASH. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine gene expression levels. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to examine hemoglobin proteins. Flow cytometry was used to measure intracellular oxidative stress. RESULTS: Analysis of microarray gene expression data has revealed a significant increase in the expression of hemoglobin alpha (HBA1) and beta (HBB) in liver biopspies from NASH patients. Increased hemoglobin expression in NASH was validated by qRT-PCR. However, the expression of erythrocyte specific marker genes such as SPTA, SPTB, GYPA, GATA1, and ALAS2 did not change, indicating that increased hemoglobin expression in NASH was not from erythropoiesis, but could result from increased expression in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated positive HBA1 and HBB expression in the hepatocytes of NASH livers. Hemoglobin expression was also observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line. Furthermore, treatment with hydrogen peroxide, a known oxidative stress inducer, induced a dose dependent increase in HBA1 expression in HepG2 cells. Intriguingly, forced hemoglobin expression suppressed oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress upregulates hemoglobin expression in hepatocytes. Suppression of oxidative stress by hemoglobin could be a mechanism to protect hepatocytes from oxidative damage. These findings suggest that hemoglobin is an inducible antioxidant in hepatocytes in response to increased oxidative stress as found in NASH livers. Twelve biopsy diagnosed NASH patients were included in this study. For control groups, total RNA from 5 different subjects were purchased from ADMET. These subjects are free from liver disease.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The placenta is the principal metabolic, respiratory, excretory, and endocrine organ for the first 9 months of fetal life. Its role in fetal and maternal physiology is remarkably diverse. Because of the central role that the placenta has in fetal and maternal physiology and development, the possibility that variation in placental gene expression patterns might be linked to important abnormalities in maternal or fetal health, or even variations in later life, warrants investigation. As an initial step, we used DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression patterns in 72 samples of amnion, chorion, umbilical cord, and sections of villus parenchyma from 19 human placentas from successful full-term pregnancies. The umbilical cord, chorion, amnion, and villus parenchyma samples were readily distinguished by differences in their global gene-expression patterns, many of which seemed to be related to physiology and histology. Differentially expressed genes have roles that include placental trophoblast secretion, signal transduction, metabolism, immune regulation, cell adhesion, and structure. We found interindividual differences in expression patterns in villus parenchyma and systematic differences between the maternal, fetal, and intermediate layers. A group of genes that was expressed in both the maternal and fetal villus parenchyma sections of placenta included genes that may be associated with preeclampsia. We identified sets of genes whose expression in placenta was significantly correlated with the sex of the fetus. This study provides a rich and diverse picture of the molecular variation in the placenta from healthy pregnancies.</field>

      <name>Transcriptional landscape of Rag2 -/- thymocytes [ShortRNA-Seq]</name>
      <description>We performed ChIP-Seq for hallmark TFs (Ets1, Runx1), histone modification marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3), total RNA Pol II, short RNA-Seq as well as nucleosome mapping mainly in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes. We also performed ChIP-Seq for E47 as well as nucleosome mapping, gene expression microarray analysis in CD4+ CD8+ DP thymocytes. Overall, we find a key role for the transcription factor Ets1, contributing towards alpha beta T cell lineage commitment via differential transactivation of stage-specific genes orchestrated by dynamic, co-association -mediated chromatin remodeling, as well as transcription dependent generation of a specialized chromatin structure at the TCR beta locus. Genome-wide analysis via ChIP-Seq for Ets1, Runx1, total RNA Pol II binding,  H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, short RNA-Seq, Mnase-Seq in murine Rag2 -/- thymocytes, ChIP-Seq for E47, Mnase-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis in DP thymocytes  This Series represents ShortRNA-Seq data.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Thymuses were extracted from 5-6-week-old Rag2-/- knockout mice and stored in RPMI medium. Cohorts of litter mates were used as biological replicates. To recover thymocytes, thymuses were subsequently passed twice through a 70µm Falcon cell strainer and stored in PBS. Cells were crosslinked 10 min in 10% formaldehyde followed by 5 min quenching in 250 mM glycine. DP cells were subsequently sorted via AutoMACS using, in turn, α-CD8-PE antibody conjugated to α-PE beads, and α-CD4 beads (Miltenyi). FACS profiles and cell purities were obtained for Rag2-/- and DP thymocytes via CD44-APC, CD25-FITC and CD8-PE, CD4-FITC staining, respectively
 Library Construction - Trizol Illumina Small RNA Rev. B protocol with some minor modifications (see below) to yield directional short RNAseq profiling. For short RNA-Seq, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications to ensure higher recovery rates of small RNAs. In brief, Rag2-/- thymocytes were divided into 1x107 aliquots and 1ml of TRIzol was added. Cells were lysed with vigorous vortexing and pipetting. Homogenized samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes and 0.2ml of chloroform was added. Samples were vigorously shaken and incubated at room temperature for an additional 5 minutes. Phase separation was carried out by centrifugation at 4°C and 12,000g in a tabletop centrifuge for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was transferred to fresh tubes and 1.5 volumes (approximately 1ml) of isopropanol together with 10μg of linear acrylamide (Ambion, USA) were added. Samples were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C and 12,000g in a tabletop centrifuge for 20 minutes. Pellets were washed with 80% ethanol, vortexed and centrifuged at 4°C and 7,500g in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 minutes. Pellets were allowed to air dry and resuspended in nuclease-free water (Ambion, USA). DNA was digested using the rigorous Turbo DNase (Ambion, USA) treatment as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity was measured on a Nanodrop 1000 and the quality was verified using RNA Nano chips on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA).Small RNAs were purified from a 10% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel, essentially as described in the Illumina Small RNA Rev. B protocol with some minor modifications. Approximately 10μg of total RNA was run at 200V for 1 hour, until the blue front reached the bottom of the gel. We used 21G needles to puncture holes into the bottom of two 0.5ml and placed them into 2ml eppendorf tubes. RNA corresponding to 15nt - 70nt was cut from the gel, diagonally cut in half and separately transferred into the 0.5ml tubes. The gel was crushed into the 2ml tubes by a two minute centrifugation at 14,000rpm. For gel elution by soaking, 0.4ml of 0.3M NaCl was added to each tube, before a 4 hour rotation at room temperature. After removal of gel particles using 0.22μm cellulose acetate filters, 10μg of linear acrylamide (Ambion, USA) and 2.5 volumes (approximately 1ml) of ice-cold absolute ethanol were added. After 30-minute incubation at -80°C, the eluted RNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 4°C and maximum speed for 45 minutes. The pellet was washed with 1ml of room temperature 80% ethanol and resuspended in 5.7μl of water. This PAGE purification step was repeated after both the 5’ and 3’ adapter ligations, which were carried out according to the protocol. The resulting cDNA was purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) using the DNA cleanup protocol modification in order to retain DNA fragments as low as 70bp. The DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, France) and verified using DNA High Sensitivity 2100 Bioanalyzer chips (Agilent, USA). The library was clustered and sequenced using 76 cycles on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, USA) at the CNAG, Barcelona, Spain, according to manufacturer’s instructions.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Pre-processing and pipeline Samples were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. We obtained the raw sequences and detected and removed the adapter sequences using the MIRO pipeline (http://seq.crg.es/main/bin/view/Home/MiroPipeline). The obtained reads were aligned against the mouse genome using the GEM aligner (http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net). Only unambiguously aligned tags were used for further analysis. Tags from technical replicates were merged. Coverage of tags was computed using bedtools genomecov and converted to wig format using a binning window of 50bp.

      <name>Expression data from collecting lymphatic vessels</name>
      <description>Lymphogenous metastasis is an important event in the progression of many human cancers, and is associated with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D). Changes to the lymphatic vasculature can occur during metastasis, and may aid metastatic spread. We investigated the effect of tumour derived VEGFD on the endothelium of the collecting lymphatic vessels draining primary tumors. We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression in the collecting lymphatic endothelium of mice with 293EBNA xenografts compared to 293EBNA xenografts overexpressing VEGFD. Mice were injected with 293EBNA cells (transfected with either empty APEX vector, or vector containing VEGFD) and tumours were allowed to grow to size. Mice were sacrificed and collecting lymphatic vessels were dissected. The endothelial cell population was isolated and RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - 293EBNA tumor cells were injected into the flank of mice. The tumors were grown until they reached a volume of 2000 mm3.
 Sample Processing - Patent Blue V was injected into the tumor to visualize the draining collecting lymphatics which were subsequently microdissected. Single cell suspensions were prepared and endothelial cell populations isolated by MAC sorting.
 Hybridization - Samples were prepared for hybridisation to the Mouse 430 version 2.0 GeneChip by preparing a probe cocktail (cRNA @ 0.05ug/ul) that includes 1x Hybridisation Buffer (100mM MES, 1m NaCl, 20mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20), 0.1mg/ml Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5mg/ml BSA, and 7% DMSO. A total hybridisation volume of 300 ul was prepared for each sample and 200 ul loaded into a Mouse 430 version 2.0 GeneChip.  The chip was hybridised at 45C for 16 hours in an oven with a rotating wheel at 60rpm.  After hybridisation the chip was washed using the appropriate fluidics script in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
 Labeling - Mouse total RNA was quality ascertained using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the Nanochip protocol. A total of 3 ug was labelled using the Affymetrix One Cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Millennium Sciences cat no. 900431). The subsequent cDNA was cleaned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup kit (Millenium Sciences cat no. 900371).  Upon cleaning of the cDNA the next step was to incorporate biotin into the resultant cRNA using the Affymetrix IVT labelling kit (Millenium Sciences cat no. 900449).  After the IVT process the labelled cRNA was cleaned using the above GeneChip Sample Cleanup kit. The quantity of product was ascertained using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the NanoChip protocol.  A total of 20ug of labelled cRNA was then fragmented to the 50-200bp size range and quality control checked using the Bioanalyser 2100 using the NanoChip protocol.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted from lymph node endothelial cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Signal&lt;br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)&lt;br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 
 Feature Extraction - Raw intensity data was analysed using GeneChip Operating Software (Affymetrix Inc) and profiles compared using AffylmGUI software (Wettenhall et al. 2006, Bioinformatics 22:897-9).
 Image Adquisition - Chips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.  The scanner operating software, GCOS, converts the signal on the chip into a DAT file, which was then used for generating subsequent CEL and CHP files for analysis.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization -  THE INSTITUTE FOR GENOMIC RESEARCHStandard Operating Procedure TITLE: MICROARRAY LABELED PROBE HYBRIDIZATION PAGE: 1 of 5 SOP #:  M005 REVISION LEVEL:  3   EFFECTIVE DATE: 9/11/02 AUTHOR:Jeremy Hasseman PRIMARY REVIEWERS:Emily Chen, Ivana Yang  1. PURPOSE  This protocol describes the hybridization of a Cy labeled cDNA probe (mix of Cy3 and Cy5) onto coated slide spotted with PCR amplified cDNA.  2. SCOPE  This procedural format is currently utilized by Human Colon Cancer and Mouse microarray projects under the supervision of John Quackenbush within the Mammalian Genomics Dept.  3. MATERIALS  3.1 20X Saline-Sodium Citrate (SSC) (Sigma; Cat # S-6639) 3.2 10% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)(Life Technologies; Cat # 15553-035) 3.3 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma; Cat # A-9418) 3.4 Formamide, redistilled (Life Technologies; Cat # 15515-081) 3.5 Isopropanol (Fisher Scientific; Cat # A451-1) 3.6 Coplin jar (VWR; Cat # 25457-200) 3.7 Human COT1-DNA (Life Technologies; Cat # 15279-011) 3.8 Mouse COT1-DNA (Life Technologies; Cat # 18440-016) 3.9 Poly(A)-DNA (Pharmacia; Cat # 27-7836-01) 3.10 Microscope Cover Glass (Fisher Scientific; Cat # 12-545J) 3.11 Corning UltraGAPSä Coated Slides (bar-coded) (Corning; Cat # 40015) 3.12 Hybridization chamber (Corning Costar; Cat #2551) 3.13 1 L .22 mm CA (cellulose acetate) Filter System (Corning; Cat #430517) 3.14 Pressurized air duster (Fellowes; Cat # 99790) or clean in-house pressurized air source  4. PROCEDURE  4.1 UV Cross-linking and Prehybridizaton   4.1.1 Aminosilane coated slides (Corning UltraGAPSä Coated Slides) spotted with cDNA in 50% DMSO are UV cross-linked at ~120 mJ.  4.1.2 Prepare prehybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA) and sterilize by filtration using a CA filter.  Preheat at 42oC for ~30 minutes before use.    4.1.3 Place the printed slide(s) to be used for the hybridization in a Coplin jar containing preheated prehybridization buffer and incubate at 42oC for 45 minutes.  4.1.4 Washing Slides   - Fill two Coplin jars with MilliQ water and another with isopropanol. - With forceps carefully grasp slide by the labeled end and vertically dip slide into the first Coplin jar (water) so that the slide is completely submerged.  Dip slide four or five times. - Dip the slide again in the water five times but only submerging the slide enough to wash the printed array itself.  - Using the same technique dip slide into the second Coplin jar (water). - Finally dip slide into the third Coplin jar (isopropanol) submerging the slide completely.   Note: Replace each water wash after every five slides.  4.1.5 Drying Slides  -    Carefully but quickly blow-dry the front of the slide with compressed air.    Note:  To avoid blowing debris from the forceps onto the array, first blow from where the array ends toward the forceps.  Then dry the array itself by blowing down the slide away from the forceps.    -     Finally dry the back of the slide. - Note the general appearance of the slide.  Streaking or mottling on the slide surface indicates further washing is necessary. - Repeat the water/water/isopropanol wash cycle as necessary to clean the slide.  Blow-dry between each cycle.    4.1.6 Use slides immediately following prehybridization to ensure optimal hybridization efficiency.  4.2 Hybridization  4.2.1 Prepare 1X hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 0.1% SDS).    4.2.2 Prepare Poly(A)-DNA by dissolving stock Poly(A)-DNA in a neutral buffer (i.e. 10 mM Tris, pH 7) to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL.  4.2.3 Prepare COT1-DNA (stock conc.1mg/mL) by ethanol precipitation:  - Add 2 to 3 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate (NaOAc) to the stock tube. - Mix well and place on dry ice for 20-30 minutes or in -20oC freezer overnight.   - Centrifuge for 20-30 minutes in a cold room microfuge at maximum angular velocity. - Remove supernatant and allow excess ethanol to dry off. - Dissolve precipitated COT1 in a neutral buffer (i.e. 10 mM Tris, pH 7) to the final concentration of 20mg/mL.  4.2.4 Resuspend labeled probe (Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture: see SOP-M004) in 24 mL of 1X hybridization buffer.  Note: Expose Cy labeled probe to light as little as possible during the hybridization process.  4.2.5 To block nonspecific hybridization add:  COT1-DNA (20 mg/mL) ... 1mL  Poly(A)-DNA (20mg/mL) ... 1mL  Note: The COT1-DNA is organism specific: add mouse COT1 to labeled mouse probes and human COT1-DNA to labeled human probes.   4.2.6 To denature, heat the probe mixture at 95oC for 3 minutes and snap cool on ice for 30 sec.    4.2.7 Centrifuge the probe mixture at maximum angular velocity for 1 minute.  Keep at room temperature and use immediately.  4.2.8 To Apply Labeled Probe Mixture  - Place a prehybridized microarray slide (array side up) between the guide teeth in the bottom half of a hybridization chamber.   - Pipette the labeled probe mixture (~26 mL) to the slide surface near one end of the array print area keeping bubbles to a minimum. - Take a 22mm x 60mm microscope glass coverslip, dust it with compressed air, and grasp one end with forceps. - Holding the coverslip over the array print area, lower the end nearest the pool of cDNA probe until solution wicks to the surface of the coverslip. - Gradually lower the opposite end of the coverslip (held by the forceps) onto the slide.  The solution may take a minute or two to wick across the entire length of the slide. - After probe has wicked across the slide carefully adjust the coverslips position with the tip of the forceps so that there is an even margin between the edge of the coverslip and the edge of the slide. - Work any large bubbles toward the edge by gently tapping the coverslip surface; small bubbles will absolve themselves during hybridization.  4.2.9 To the small wells at each end of the chamber add 10 mL of water (20mL total), cover, and seal the chamber.  4.2.10 Wrap the chamber in foil (light-tight) and incubate in a 42oC water bath for 16-20 hours.  To ensure chamber remains level and does not float to the surface place a small weight upon it.  Note: Do not flip the hybridization chamber upside down during hybridization; this may cause the coverslip to shift from the slide and adversely affect the hybridization.  4.2.11 Prepare a low stringency wash buffer (~500mL) containing 1X SSC and 0.2% SDS and a high-stringency wash buffer (~500mL) containing 0.1X SSC and 0.2% SDS.  4.2.12 After the incubation remove foil and unseal hybridization chamber.  Remove the slide from the chamber, taking care not to disturb the coverslip.  4.2.13 To remove coverslip submerge slide in a dish containing low stringency wash buffer (preheated to 42oC).  With forceps shake the slide gently to loosen the coverslip.  With time the coverslip will slide free of the slide surface.  Note: Once the slide has been hybridized it should be exposed to light as little as possible.  Therefore, all staining dishes should be covered with foil to make them light tight.  4.2.14 After the coverslip is removed place slide in a staining dish containing lower stringency wash buffer (preheated to 42oC) and agitate for 4 minutes.  4.2.15 Wash the slide in a staining dish with high stringency wash buffer by agitating for 4 minutes at room temperature.  4.2.16 Wash the slide in 0.1X SSC agitating for 4 minutes at room temperature. (alternatively one can wash twice in 0.1X SSC agitating for 2.5 minutes to minimize SDS carryover.)  4.2.17 Finally dip the slide in a Coplin jar filled with water several times and blow dry using the same technique as step 4.1.4.  4.2.18 Place slides in a light tight slide box until they can be scanned, preferably as soon as possible. 
 Labeling -  THE INSTITUTE FOR GENOMIC RESEARCH Standard Operating Procedure TITLE: AMINOALLYL LABELING OF RNA FOR MICROARRAYS SOP #:  M004 REVISION LEVEL:  2 EFFECTIVE DATE: 3/4/02  AUTHOR: Jeremy Hasseman  PRIMARY REVIEWERS: Emily Chen, Ivana Yang   1. PURPOSE    This protocol describes the labeling of eukaryotic RNA with aminoallyl labeled  nucleotides via first strand cDNA synthesis followed by a coupling of the  aminoallyl groups to either Cyanine 3 or 5 (Cy 3/Cy5) fluorescent molecules.  2. SCOPE  This procedural format is utilized by Human Colon Cancer and Mouse microarray  projects under the supervision of John Quackenbush within the Eukaryotic  Genomics Dept.  3.

REAGENT PREPARATION  4.1 Phosphate Buffers  4.1.1 Prepare 2 solutions: 1M K2HPO4 and 1M KH2PO4  4.1.2 To make a 1M Phosphate buffer (KPO4, pH 8.5-8.7) combine:  1M K2HPO4 ..9.5 mL 1M KH2PO4 ..0.5 mL   4.1.3 For 100 mL Phosphate wash buffer (5 mM KPO4, pH 8.0, 80%  EtOH) mix:   1 M  KPO4 pH 8.5...  0.5 mL  MilliQ water ... 15.25 mL  95% ethanol ... 84.25 mL  Note:  Wash buffer will be slightly cloudy.  4.1.4 Phosphate elution buffer is made by diluting 1 M KPO4, pH 8.5 to  4 mM with MilliQ water.  4.2 Aminoallyl dUTP   4.2.1 For a final concentration of 100mM add 19.1 µL of 0.1 M KPO4  buffer (pH 7.5) to a stock vial containing 1 mg of aa-dUTP.  Gently  vortex to mix and transfer the aa-dUTP solution into a new  microfuge tube.  Store at -20oC.  4.2.2 Measure the concentration of the aa-dUTP solution by diluting an  aliquot 1:5000 in 0.1 M KPO4 (pH 7.5) and measuring the OD289.   (Stock concentration in mM = OD289 x 704)  4.3 Labeling Mix (50X) with 2:3 aa-dUTP: dTTP ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           4.3.1 Mix the following reagents:                Final concentration dATP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dCTP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dGTP (100 mM) 5µL... (25 mM) dTTP (100 mM) 3µL... (15 mM) aa-dUTP (100 mM) 2µL... (10 mM)     Total: 20µL  4.3.1 Store unused solution at -20oC.  4.4 Sodium Carbonate Buffer (Na2CO3):  1M, pH 9.0  4.4.1 Dissolve 10.8 g Na2CO3 in 80 mL of MilliQ water and adjust pH to  9.0 with 12 N HCl; bring volume up to 100 mL with MilliQ water.  4.4.2 To make a 0.1 M solution for the dye coupling reaction dilute 1:10  with water.  Note:   Carbonate buffer changes composition over time; make it fresh  every couple of weeks to a month.  4.5  Cy-dye esters   4.5.1 Cy3-ester and Cy5-ester are provided as a dried product in 5 tubes.   Resuspend a tube of dye ester in 73 ?L of DMSO before use.  4.5.2 Wrap all reaction tubes with foil and keep covered as much as  possible in order to prevent photobleaching of the dyes.   Note: Dye esters must either be used immediately or aliquotted and  stored at -80oC.  Any introduced water to the dye esters will result  in a lower coupling efficiency due to the hydrolysis of the dye  esters.  Since DMSO is hygroscopic (absorbs water from the  atmosphere) store it well sealed in desiccant.    5. PROCEDURE  5.1 Aminoallyl Labeling  5.1.1 To 10 ?g of total RNA (or 2 ?g poly(A+) RNA) which has been  DNase I-treated and Qiagen RNeasy purified, add 2 ?L Random  Hexamer primers (3mg/mL) and bring the final volume up to 18.5  ?L with RNase-free water.  5.1.2 Mix well and incubate at 70oC for 10 minutes.  5.1.3 Snap-freeze in dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 seconds, centrifuge  briefly at >10,000 rpm and continue at room temperature.  5.1.4 Add:  5X First Strand buffer .. 6 ?L 0.1 M  DTT  .. 3 ?L 50X aminoallyl-dNTP mix .. 0.6 ?L SuperScript II RT (200U/?L) .. 2 ?L 5.1.5 Mix and incubate at 42oC for 3 hours to overnight.  5.1.6 To hydrolyze RNA, add:   1 M  NaOH    10 ?L  0.5 M  EDTA   10 ?L   mix and incubate at 65oC for 15 minutes.  5.1.7 Add 10 ?L of 1 M HCl to neutralize pH.  (Alternatively, one can  add 25 ?L 1 M HEPES pH 7.0 or 25 ?L 1 M Tris pH 7.4)   5.2 Reaction Purification I:  Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free  amines (use either the Qiagen or the Microcon method)   Qiagen Cleanup Method:  Note: This purification protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick  PCR purification kit protocol.  The phosphate wash and elution  buffers (prepared in 4.1.3 and 4.1.4) are substituted for the Qiagen  supplied buffers because the Qiagen buffers contain free amines  which compete with the Cy dye coupling reaction.  5.2.1 Mix cDNA reaction with 300 ?L (5X reaction volume) buffer PB  (Qiagen supplied) and transfer to QIAquick column.  5.2.2 Place the column in a 2 ml collection tube (Qiagen supplied) and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.2.3 To wash, add 750 ?L phosphate wash buffer to the column and  centrifuge at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.4 Empty the collection tube and repeat the wash and centrifugation  step (5.2.3).   5.2.5 Empty the collection tube and centrifuge column an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.  5.2.6 Transfer column to a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L phosphate elution buffer (see 4.1.4) to the center of the  column membrane.  5.2.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.2.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.2.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.2.6-  5.2.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  5.2.10 Dry sample in a speed vac.  or~ Microcon YM-30 Cleanup Method:  5.2.1 Place the Microcon sample reservoir into a collection microfuge  tube.  Add 375 ?L of water to the cDNA reaction tube and then  pipette the sample into the Microcon sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube without touching the membrane.  5.2.2 Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 min.   Note: Never centrifuge column to dryness as this will decrease product  recovery.  Adjust spin time to allow for optimal filtration while  allowing enough solution to remain for sufficient recovery.  5.2.3 Empty collection microfuge tube.  5.2.4 To wash add 450 ?L of water to the sample reservoir/collection  microfuge tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 6-10 minutes.    5.2.5 Empty collection microfuge tube and repeat previous wash step.  5.2.6 Invert Microcon sample reservoir into a new collection microfuge  tube and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute to collect purified  sample.  5.2.7 Dry the sample in a speed vac.    5.3 Coupling aa-cDNA to Cy Dye Ester.  5.3.1 Resuspend aminoallyl-labeled cDNA in 4.5 ?L 0.1 M sodium  carbonate buffer (Na2CO3), pH 9.0.  Note: Carbonate buffer changes composition over time so make sure you  make it fresh every couple of weeks to a month.  5.3.2 Add 4.5 ?L of the appropriate NHS-ester Cy dye (prepared in  DMSO: see 4.5)  Note: To prevent photobleaching of the Cy dyes wrap all reaction tubes  in foil and keep them sequestered from light as much as possible.   5.3.3 Incubate the reaction for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.  5.4 Reaction Purification II:  Removal of uncoupled dye (Qiagen PCR  Purification Kit)  5.4.1 To the reaction add 35 ?L 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2.  5.4.2 Add 250 ?L (5X reaction volume) Buffer PB (Qiagen supplied).  5.4.3 Place a QIAquick spin column in a 2 mL collection tube (Qiagen  supplied), apply the sample to the column, and centrifuge at  ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Empty collection tube.  5.4.4 To wash, add 0.75 mL Buffer PE (Qiagen supplied) to the column  and centrifuge at ~13,000 for 1 minute.  Note: Make sure Buffer PE has added ethanol before using (see label for  correct volume).  5.4.5 Empty collection tube and centrifuge column for an additional 1  minute at maximum speed.   5.4.6 Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microfuge tube and carefully add  30 ?L Buffer EB (Qiagen supplied) to the center of the column  membrane.  5.4.7 Incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.  5.4.8 Elute by centrifugation at ~13,000 rpm for 1 minute.  5.4.9 Elute a second time into the same tube by repeating steps 5.4.6-  5.4.8.  The final elution volume should be ~60 ?L.  Note: This protocol is modified from the Qiagen QIAquick Spin  Handbook (04/2000, pg. 18).  5.5 Analysis of Labeling Reaction  5.5.1 Use a 50 ?L Beckman quartz MicroCuvette to analyze the entire  undiluted sample in a spectrophotometer.  5.5.2 Wash the cuvette with water and blow dry with compressed air  duster.  5.5.3 Pipette sample into cuvette and place cuvette in spectrophotometer.  5.5.4 For each sample measure absorbance at 260 nm and either 550 nm  for Cy3 or 650 nm for Cy5, as appropriate.  5.5.5 Pipette sample from cuvette back into the original sample tube.  5.5.6 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of cDNA synthesized  using:   pmol nucleotides = [OD260 * volume (uL) * 37 ng/?L * 1000 pg/ng]      324.5 pg/pmol  Note: 1 OD260 = 37 ng/?L for cDNA; 324.5 pg/pmol average molecular  weight of a dNTP) 5.5.7 For each sample calculate the total picomoles of dye incorporation  (Cy3 or Cy5 accordingly) using:  pmol Cy3  = OD550 * volume (?L)    0.15  pmol Cy5 = OD650 * volume (?L)    0.25  nucleotides/dye ratio =     pmol cDNA                  pmol Cy dye  Note:   >200 pmol of dye incorporation per sample and a ratio of less than  50 nucleotides/dye molecules is optimal for hybridizations (see  Microarray Cookbook II)   5.5.8 After analysis mix together the two differentially labeled probes  (Cy3 vs. Cy5) which will be hybridized to the same microarray  slide.  5.5.9 Dry the Cy3/Cy5 probe mixture to completion in a speed vac and  continue with SOP: M005 for the hybridization of the probe to a  microarray slide.</field>

      <name>Transcriptome reorganization during wood maturation in Pinus radiata</name>
      <description>Wood maturation produces two distinct wood tissues: juvenile wood (JW) and mature wood (LW), which are the major cause of wood qaulity variation within a tree. We investigate transcriptome reorganization during wood maturation process in radiata pine using a newly developed 18k cDNA microarrays. Developing xylem tissues from nine sampled trees at 5- and 13-year-old each were randomly divided into three groups with three trees each. Total RNA samples extracted from three trees within a group were pooled at equal amount before using for microarray experiments. Using this pooling strategy three biological replicates were formed for each microarray experiment. Dye swap was applied in each biological replicate. Comparisons between JW and MW in spring (EW) and autumn (LW) were arranged in two separate microarray experiments: juvenile earlywood (JE) vs. mature earlywood (ME), juvenile latewood (JL) vs. mature latewood (ML)</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Nine radiata pine trees (different genotypes) at juvenile (5 yrs) and mature (13 yrs) ages (based on wood ring number at breast height, 1.3m) each were sampled in commercial plantations at Bondo, NSW (35º 16' 44.04 S, 148º 26' 54.66 E). The 18 sampled trees were growing within 100 m of each other with similar field environment.
 Sample Processing - Developing xylem tissues from trees at juvneile (5 yrs) and mature (13 yrs) ages were collected on the same dates in spring (October) and autumn (March) to represent earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) samples, respectively. To avoid the presence of compression wood in the samples, EW and LW tissues were collected from the same tree at breast height (1.3m) on opposite sides of the trunk perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. The xylem tissues were scraped from the exposed xylem surface with a sharp chisel after removing the bark of the sampling area. Each time of sample collection was finished within two hours in the morning to minimize the fluctuated gene expression. The sampled tissues were immediately placed into liquid nitrogen in the field until stored in the lab at -80oC.
 Hybridization - Labelled cDNA was hybridised using the radiata pine 18K cDNA microarrays developed in CSIRO Plant Industry. Slides were placed in water bath for 16 h at 42 °C. Arrays then washed in 2x SSC (+0.1 % SDS) at 42 °C, 0.1x SSC (+0.1 % SDS), 0.1x SSC and 0.01x SSC at room temperature, each for 5 min prior to drying and scanning.
 Labeling - Equal amounts of total RNA (20 or 30 µg) of the two samples to be compared were reversely transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase, and generated fluorescently labelled cDNA using Alexa Fluor® 555-aha-dUTP and Alexa Fluor® 647-aha-dUTP, following the protocol of the SuperScriptTM Plus Direst cDNA Labelling System (Invitrogen, CA).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Developing xylem tissues were ground and total RNA was extracted using the method of Chang et al (1993) with a slight modification</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Pint-tip lowess and slide scale normalized log2 ratio (mature wood/juvenile wood)
 Feature Extraction - Data analysis was carried out using GEPAS v3.1. The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalized using print-tip lowess and slide scale normalization.
 Image Adquisition - Hybridized microarray slides were scanned using GenePix Personal 4100A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, CA). Image pre-processing was performed using GenePix® Pro 4.0 and Acuity software (Axon Instruments, CA).</field>

      <name>Gene expression profiling of the ileum following vertical sleeve gastrectomy compared to pair-fed sham surgery controls in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity.</name>
      <description>We report the expression profiles of ileal samples extracted from obese male C57Bl6 mice following vertical sleeve gastrectomy or sham surgery, focusing of gene signatures indicative of altered bile acid metabolism. We induced obesity in male C57bl6 mice through a high-fat diet.  At 8 weeks, they were submitted to either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) or a sham surgery; following surgery VSG mice were fed ad libitum while sham controls were pair-fed (SPF) to the experimental animals.  During the four perioperative days, mice were fed a liquid Osmolite diet. Approximately 8 weeks after surgery mice were fasted overnight and gavaged with .5mL Osmolite; after one hour mice were sacrificed and the terminal ileum were extracted.   RNA was extracted, quantified, and compared between VSG and SPF experimental groups.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Bariatric surgical procedures, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), are at present the most effective therapy for the treatment of obesity, and are associated with considerable improvements in co-morbidities, including type-2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these benefits remain largely undetermined, despite offering the potential to reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Substantial changes in circulating total bile acids are known to occur after VSG. Moreover, bile acids are known to regulate metabolism by binding to the nuclear receptor FXR (farsenoid-X receptor, also known as NR1H4). We therefore examined the results of VSG surgery applied to mice with diet-induced obesity and targeted genetic disruption of FXR. Here we demonstrate that the therapeutic value of VSG does not result from mechanical restriction imposed by a smaller stomach. Rather, VSG is associated with increased circulating bile acids, and associated changes to gut microbial communities. Moreover, in the absence of FXR, the ability of VSG to reduce body weight and improve glucose tolerance is substantially reduced. These results point to bile acids and FXR signalling as an important molecular underpinning for the beneficial effects of this weight-loss surgery.</field>

      <name>Protective role of Apolipoprotein E in experimental acute renal allogaft rejection</name>
      <description>Objective: Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is a multifunctional protein, originally described in the context of lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular disease. More recently, anti-inflammatory functions of ApoE have been documented. ApoE was studied in the context of several inflammatory disorders, but its role in the pathogenesis of acute organ rejection is unknown. In this study, we test the hypothesis that ApoE attenuates acute renal allograft rejection. Materials and methods: The Dark Agouti (DA) to Lewis (Lew) and the Brown Norway (BN) to Lew rat strain combinations were used to investigate fatal acute rejection. In addition, Fischer 344 (F344) kidneys were transplanted to Lew rats to study reversible acute rejection. Isograft recipients and untreated Lew rats were used as controls. ApoE mRNA expression was quantified in intravascular leukocytes accumulating in the blood vessels of renal grafts and in graft tissue. Apo E protein levels were assessed in blood plasma. To test the protective potential of ApoE, recipients of BN kidneys were treated with ApoE-mimetic peptide. Results: Intravascular graft leukocytes and renal tissue obtained from animals undergoing reversible acute rejection expressed increased levels of ApoE mRNA, whereas during fatal rejection, ApoE expression remained unchanged in the BN to Lew rat strain combination or was significantly reduced when DA rats were used as donors of the kidney. On the protein level, no changes in ApoE were seen in plasma. However, we do not know if local leukocytic ApoE expression results in increased ApoE concentrations inside graft blood vessels. Peptide treatment of allograft recipients reversed fatal rejection and significantly improved animal survival. Conclusions: ApoE plays a protective role in acute organ rejection. Further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanism how ApoE reverses acute rejection. dual-color balanced dye-swap design with 4 biological replicates, hybridized on 4 arrays</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The nuclear transcription factor estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) is the target of several antiestrogen therapeutic agents for breast cancer. However, many ER-alpha positive patients do not respond to these treatments from the beginning, or stop responding after being treated for a period of time. Because of the association of gene transcription alteration and drug resistance and the emerging evidence on the role of DNA methylation on transcription regulation, understanding of these relationships can facilitate development of approaches to re-sensitize breast cancer cells to treatment by restoring DNA methylation patterns.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We found that compared with the WT cell lines, almost all of the genes in OHT or ICI resistant cell lines either do not show methylation change or hypomethylated. Moreover, the correlations between gene expression and methylation are quite heterogeneous across genes, suggesting the involvement of other factors in regulating transcription. Analysis of our results in combination with H3K4me2 data on OHT resistant cell lines suggests a clear interplay between DNA methylation and H3K4me2 in the regulation of gene expression. For hypomethylated genes with alteration of gene expression, most (~80%) are up-regulated, consistent with current view on the relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We developed an empirical Bayes model to study the association between DNA methylation in the promoter region and gene expression. Our approach generates both global (across all genes) and local (individual gene) views of the interplay. It provides important insight on future effort to develop therapeutic agent to re-sensitize breast cancer cells to treatment.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Purified and labeled cRNA (28 pmol of Cy3 labeled cRNA) was hybridised on Agilent Human Whole Genome 4x44K G4112F arrays followed by (manual) washing, according to the manufacturer's procedures
 Labeling - RNA concentration and RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent). Per sample, an amount of 800 pg - 20 ng (samples of exp1016) and 3.8 ng - 10 ng (samples of exp1113) of total RNA was amplified in a 2-cycle amplification reaction as described by Baugh et al. (PMID: 11222780). During the second in vitro transcription reaction, the sample was amplified and labeled with Cyanine 3-CTP (Cy3) according to AgilentÕs protocol.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Tumor samples were either immediately processed for flow-cytometric analysis after resection, or cryopreserved as small pieces, followed by storage at -196°C for later. Dissociated cells were processed for SP analysis. Total SP and MP cells were sorted by FACS into cold lysis solution of the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Total RNA was extracted immediately after cell collection according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA samples were stored at -80°C until further processing for whole-genome expression profiling. (in collaboration with the VIB Nucleomics Core, KU Leuven).
 Scaning - To assess the raw probe signal intensities, arrays were scanned using the Agilent DNA MicroArray Scanner with surescan High-Resolution Technology and probe signals were quantified using Agilent’s Feature Extraction software (version 10.1.1.1).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - The analysis is based on the expression values as obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software. Control probes and probes that were below background in all samples were removed. To decide whether a signal was significantly above background, we use the feature gIsPosAndSignif, also provided by the Agilent software. Signals were log2-transformed and then normalized with quantile normalization. Values for duplicated probes were subsequently averaged. The reported values are on log2-scale. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 quantile normalized</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Pituitary adenomas cause significant endocrine and mass-related morbidity. Little is known about the mechanisms that underlie pituitary tumor pathogenesis. In the present study, we searched for a side population (SP) in pituitary tumors representing cells with high efflux capacity and potentially enriched for tumor stem cells (TSCs). Human pituitary adenomas contain a SP irrespective of hormonal phenotype. This adenoma SP, as well as the purified SP (pSP) that is depleted from endothelial and immune cells, is enriched for cells that express 'tumor stemness' markers and signaling pathways, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-linked factors. Pituitary adenomas were found to contain self-renewing sphere-forming cells, considered to be a property of TSCs. These sphere-initiating cells were recovered in the pSP. Because benign pituitary adenomas do not grow in vitro and have failed to expand in immunodeficient mice, the pituitary tumor cell line AtT20 was further used. We identified a SP in this cell line and found it to be more tumorigenic than the non-SP 'main population'. Of the two EMT regulatory pathways tested, the inhibition of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling reduced EMT-associated cell motility in vitro as well as xenograft tumor growth, whereas the activation of TGFβ had no effect. The human adenoma pSP also showed upregulated expression of the pituitary stem cell marker SOX2. Pituitaries from dopamine receptor D2 knockout (Drd2(-/-)) mice that bear prolactinomas contain more pSP, Sox2(+), and colony-forming cells than WT glands. In conclusion, we detected a SP in pituitary tumors and identified TSC-associated characteristics. The present study adds new elements to the unraveling of pituitary tumor pathogenesis and may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of E.coli biofilms treated with 7-hydroxyindole and isatin</name>
      <description>For the microarray experiments, 10 g glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) were used to form biofilms (30) in 250 mL in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks which were inoculated with overnight cultures diluted that were 1:100.  For EHEC with 7-hydroxyindole and isatin, 1000 mM 7-hydroxyindole in 250 mL DMF, 250 mM isatin in 250 mL DMF, or 250 mL DMF alone were added to cells grown in LB.  The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and 30°C for 7 hours to form biofilms on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the suspension cells and the biofilm.

 Labeling - The total RNA samples were first converted into cDNA through a reverse transcription reaction with poly-A RNA controls spiked into the same reaction mixture to monitor the entire target labeling process.  The cDNA was then digested with DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) to produce 50-200 bp fragments, which was checked by running the fragmented cDNA on a 2% agarose gel.  The fragmented cDNA was labeled at the 3’ termini by the Enzo BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit with Biotin-ddUTP (Affymetrix, P/N 900181).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - To lyse the cells, 1.0 mL RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and 0.2 mL 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec) were added to the frozen bead beater tubes containing the cell pellets. The tubes were closed tightly and beat for 50 seconds at the maximum speed in a mini bead beater (cat. no. 3110BX, Biospec). The total RNA was isolated by following the protocol of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) including an on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen).</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Since indole is present at up to 500 microM in the stationary phase and is an interspecies biofilm signal (J. Lee, A. Jayaraman, and T. K. Wood, BMC Microbiol. 7:42, 2007), we investigated hydroxyindoles as biofilm signals and found them also to be nontoxic interspecies biofilm signals for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC), E. coli K-12, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The genetic basis of EHEC biofilm formation was also explored, and notably, virulence genes in biofilm cells were repressed compared to those in planktonic cells. In Luria-Bertani medium (LB) on polystyrene with quiescent conditions, 7-hydroxyindole decreased EHEC biofilm formation 27-fold and decreased K-12 biofilm formation 8-fold without affecting the growth of planktonic cells. 5-Hydroxyindole also decreased biofilm formation 11-fold for EHEC and 6-fold for K-12. In contrast, isatin (indole-2,3-dione) increased biofilm formation fourfold for EHEC, while it had no effect for K-12. When continuous-flow chambers were used, confocal microscopy revealed that EHEC biofilm formation was reduced 6-fold by indole and 10-fold by 7-hydroxyindole in LB. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that isatin represses indole synthesis by repressing tnaABC 7- to 37-fold in EHEC, and extracellular indole levels were found to be 20-fold lower. Furthermore, isatin repressed the AI-2 transporters lsrABCDFGKR, while significantly inducing the flagellar genes flgABCDEFGHIJK and fliAEFGILMNOPQ (which led to a 50% increase in motility). 7-Hydroxyindole induces the biofilm inhibitor/stress regulator ycfR and represses cysADIJPU/fliC (which led to a 50% reduction in motility) and purBCDEFHKLMNRT. Isogenic mutants showed that 7-hydroxyindole inhibits E. coli biofilm through cysteine metabolism. 7-Hydroxyindole (500 microM) also stimulates P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation twofold; therefore, hydroxyindoles are interspecies bacterial signals, and 7-hydroxyindole is a potent EHEC biofilm inhibitor.</field>

      <name>Smoking-induced Wnt pathway downregulation</name>
      <description>The Wnt pathway plays a central role in controlling differentiation of epithelial tissues; when Wnt is on, differentiation is suppressed, but when Wnt is off, differentiation is allowed to proceed. Based on this concept, we hypothesized that expression of key genes in the Wnt pathway are suppressed in the human airway epithelium under the stress of cigarette smoking, a stress associated with dysregulation of the differentiated state of the airway epithelium. For this purpose, HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to assess the expression of Wnt-related genes in the small airway (10th-12th generation) epithelium (SAE) obtained via bronchoscopy and brushing of healthy nonsmokers (n=47), healthy smokers (n=58), and smokers with established COPD (n=22). With expression defined as present in >20% of samples, microarray analysis demonstrated that 35 of 57 known Wnt-related genes are expressed in the adult SAE. Wnt pathway downstream targets β-catenin (p&lt;0.05) and the transcription factor 7-like 1 were down-regulated in healthy smokers, and smokers with COPD, as were a number of Wnt target genes, including VEGFA, CCND1, MMP7, CLDN1, SOX9, RHOU (all p&lt;0.05 compared to healthy nonsmokers). As a mechanism to explain this broad, smoking-induced suppression of the Wnt pathway, we assessed expression of the DKK and SFRP families, extracellular regulators that suppress the Wnt pathway. Among these, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was up-regulated 4.3-fold (p&lt;0.0001) in healthy smokers and 4.9-fold (p&lt;0.0001) in COPD smokers, an observation confirmed by TaqMan Real-time PCR. AT the protein levels, Western analysis demonstrated SFRP2 up-regulation, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the smoking-induced SFRP2 upregulation occurred in differentiated ciliated cells. Finally, cigarette smoke extract mediated up-regulation of SFRP2 and downregulation of Wnt target genes in airway epithelial cells in vitro. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the Wnt pathway plays a role in airway epithelial cell differentiation in the adult human airway epithelium, with smoking associated with down-regulation of Wnt pathway, contributing to the dysregulation of airway epithelial differentiation observed in the smoking-related airway disorders. Affymetrix arrays were used to assess gene expression data of genes in the Wnt pathway in small airway epithelium obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of 47 healthy non-smokers and 58 healthy smokers and 22 smokers with COPD.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Smoking down-regulates the Wnt pathway in the human airway epithelium. In the context that Wnt pathway plays an important role in differentiation of epithelial tissues, the down-regulation of Wnt pathway may contribute to the dysregulation of airway epithelium differentiation observed in smoking-related airway disorders.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The Wnt pathway mediates differentiation of epithelial tissues; depending on the tissue types, Wnt can either drive or inhibit the differentiation process. We hypothesized that key genes in the Wnt pathway are suppressed in the human airway epithelium under the stress of cigarette smoking, a stress associated with dysregulation of the epithelial differentiated state.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Microarrays were used to assess the expression of Wnt-related genes in the small airway epithelium (SAE) obtained via bronchoscopy and brushing of healthy nonsmokers, healthy smokers, and smokers with COPD. Thirty-three of 56 known Wnt-related genes were expressed in the SAE. Wnt pathway downstream mediators β-catenin and the transcription factor 7-like 1 were down-regulated in healthy smokers and smokers with COPD, as were many Wnt target genes. Among the extracellular regulators that suppress the Wnt pathway, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was up-regulated 4.3-fold in healthy smokers and 4.9-fold in COPD smokers, an observation confirmed by TaqMan Real-time PCR, Western analysis and immunohistochemistry. Finally, cigarette smoke extract mediated up-regulation of SFRP2 and down-regulation of Wnt target genes in airway epithelial cells in vitro.</field>

      <description>modENCODE_submission_3153 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Jason Lieb. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The focus of our analysis will be elements that specify nucleosome positioning and occupancy, control domains of gene expression, induce repression of the X chromosome, guide mitotic segregation and genome duplication, govern homolog pairing and recombination during meiosis, and organize chromosome positioning within the nucleus. 126 strategically selected targets include key histone modifications, histone variants, RNA polymerase II isoforms, dosage-compensation proteins, centromere components, homolog-pairing facilitators, recombination markers, and nuclear-envelope constituents. We will integrate information generated with existing knowledge on the biology of the targets, perform ChIP-chip analysis on mutant and RNAi extracts lacking selected target proteins, use extrachromosomal arrays to assess the ability of candidate identified sequence motifs to recruit targets in vivo, identify tissue-specific patterns of selected targets, and create integrated, quantitative models of transcription and whole-chromosome functions. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-chip.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Worm_embryo_growth_and_harvest_v5. Embryos were prepared by bleaching from gravid N2 adults grown in standard S-basal media liquid culture. Live embryos were cross-linked in M9 + 2% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by quenching with 125mM glycine for 5 minutes. Embryos were then washed twice with M9 Buffer and once by FA buffer (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl).  Pellets were frozen at -80C.
 Hybridization - ChIP-chip_label_hyb_nimblegen_v2. DNA was labeled and hybridized to NimbleGen C. elegans tiling array (HD2) according to the protocol described in chapter 3 and 4 of the NimbleGen Arrays User?s Guide ChIP-chip Analysis, Version 3.1, 27 May 2008 with slight modifications. Briefly, amplified IP or input DNA was either labeled with Cy5 or Cy3 in the presence of Klenow fragment. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA. Labeled DNA was recovered by isopropanol precipitation, and dried. The labeled DNA was hybridized to C. elegans tiling array for 16 - 20 hours at 42°C.

 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Worm_LM-PCR_Amplification_for_ChIP-chip_vKI2. ChIP or input DNA was incubated with T4-DNA polymerase followed by T4-polynucleotide kinase to ensure 5?-phospho and 3?-hydroxyl blunt ends. The DNA fragments were ligated to the double-strand DNA linker with 5?-phosphate and then amplified by using primer corresponding to the linker sequences.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Feature Extraction - ChIP-chip normalization standard MA2C:JL:2 protocol. ChIP-chip_normalization_standard_MA2C_v2. First, all the IP and INPUT log ratio values are read from the pairdata file. Secondly, we build GC bins for INPUT and IP based on the GC counts for every probe sequence, which means that the INPUT or IP values for any probes which have the same GC counts will be put together. After that, for each GC bin, we calculate the mean for IP and INPUT data, and the covariance between this two channels. By default, the robust mean variance method is applied, which generalizes Tukey's theory of bi-weight estimation where the constant C is set to 2.  At last, we adjust the log ratio values for each probe by using the mean and covariance values for their corresponding GC bins, then these values are further normalized by their mean and standard derivation. In a single experiment, median within the sliding window defined by 2x bandwidth parameter is assigned as MA2C score at the center of each probe. In case of replicates, when we calculate the MA2Cscore afterwards, we take the median as the score from all the replicates for all the probes within the sliding window defined by 2x bandwidth parameter.  Processed data are obtained using following parameters: genome version is WS190
 Image Adquisition - ChIP-chip_scanning_nimblegen_v2. Array scanning and raw data extraction were performed according to the protocol described in chapter 5 and 6 of the NimbleGen Arrays User?s Guide ChIP-chip Analysis, Version 3.1, 27 May 2008. Briefly, array signal was scanned by using a GenePix 4000B Scanner with associated software and saved as .tif files of the 532nm and 635nm images individually. Raw signal intensities of the images were extracted and saved as .pair files by using NimbleScan software v2.5 according to the NimbleScan User?s Guide.</field>

      <name>Histone variant H2A.Z.2 mediates proliferation and drug sensitivity of malignant melanoma (expression)</name>
      <description>Here we report a novel role for H2A.Z.2 (H2AFV) as a mediator of cell proliferation and sensitivity to targeted therapies in malignant melanoma. While both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 are highly expressed in metastatic melanoma and correlate with decreased patient survival, only H2A.Z.2 deficiency results in impaired cellular proliferation of melanoma cells, which occurs via a G1/S arrest. Integrated gene expression and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that H2A.Z.2 positively regulates E2F target genes, and that such genes acquire a distinct H2A.Z occupancy signature over the promoter and gene body in metastatic melanoma cells. We further identified the BET family member BRD2 as an H2A.Z-interacting protein in melanoma cells, and demonstrate that H2A.Z.2 silencing cooperates with BET inhibition to induce cell death. Total RNA samples from SKmel147 melanoma cell line. Transcript levels were analyzed after control or H2AZ variant RNA interference.</description>

NIH3T3* samples: We correlated UBF1/2 binding across the genome with that of RNA polemerase I (Pol I), RNA polemerase II (Pol II) and chromatin states in NIH3T3 cells We perfromed ChIP-seq of UBF1/2 (2 biological replicates), Pol I (POLR1A/RPA194), Pol II, H3K9me3, H3K4Me3, H3K9ac, H4 hyperacetylation and genomic DNA input as reference.  HMEC* samples: We report ChIP-Seq analysis of UBF1/2 and Pol I (POLR1A/RPA194) in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). In addition we include UBF1/2 ChIP-seq in the tumourigenic epithelial cell line HMLER.  In this study, we compared UBF1/2 binding in HMEC to UBF1/2 binding in in the tumorigenic HMLER cells, an isogenic HMEC-derived cell line expressing the SV40 large-T, TERT, and an oncogenic allele of the HRAS gene (expressing HRASV12G) that forms tumors in nude mice (Elenbaas et al., Gene &amp; Development 2001) We sequenced UBF1/2 ChIP and Pol I(POLR1A/RPA194) ChIP and gDNA input from HMEC. We sequenced UBF1/2 ChIP and gDNA input from HMLER</description>

      <name>RTN1 IS A NOVEL MEDIATOR FOR PROGRESSION OF KIDNEY DISEASE</name>
      <description>Gene expression profiling of kidneys from the murine model of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) identified an association between the expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein reticulon-1, RTN1, and the severity of kidney disease. Of the three known RTN1 isoforms, only RTN1A protein expression was increased in kidneys of murine models of HIVAN, diabetic nephropathy (DN), and renal fibrosis and humans with HIVAN and DN. Both mRNA and protein expression of RTN1-A in the kidneys correlated inversely with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with DN. In kidney cells, RTN1 overexpression induced ER stress/apoptosis, whereas RTN1 knockdown attenuated tunicamycin-, and hyperglycemia-induced ER stress/apoptosis. Incubation of kidney cells with high glucose media induced RTN1A expression likely through oxidative pathway, while knockdown of RTN1A inhibited high glucose-induced apoptosis. RTN1A interacts with PERK and mutation of its N- or C-terminal domain abolished its effects on ER stress/apoptosis. In vivo, knockdown of Rtn1a expression either before or after kidney injury attenuated renal fibrosis in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and tubular epithelial cell-specific knockdown of Rtn1a also ameliorated ER stress and renal fibrosis in the UUO mice. Finally, knockdown of Rtn1a also attenuated proteinuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and mesangial expansion in STZ-induced diabetic mice, which were associated with suppression of ER stress markers. Taken together, these data suggest that RTN1 is a mediator of kidney disease progression that exacerbates kidney injury through ER stress and apoptosis. Animal studies: All animal studies were approved by the IACUC committee of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. HIV-1 transgenic mice, Tg26, and their littermates were generated and genotyped as described. Only male heterozygous Tg26 in the FVB/N background were used in the study, because homozygous HIV-transgenic mice are not viable for more than few weeks postnatally. UUO and folic acid-induced nephropathy models were created as described . Mice were grouped as wild type, Tg26 with mild kidney injury, Tg26, with serious kidney injury. The kidneys were collected from these mice for histology, western blot, real-time PCR analysis, and microarray studies. Kidney disease was confirmed by measurement of proteinuria, renal function, and histologic analysis. Microarray studies: Affymetrix gene expression microarrays were performed at the Mount Sinai Institution Microarray Core Facility. The Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array was used to profile gene expression in the kidney cortex of Tg26 and WT mice 37. One-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) was applied to the dataset to identify the genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups.  P-values were corrected using Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) with a threshold of 0.05.</description>

      <name>MORC1 represses transposable elements in the mouse male germ line</name>
      <description>The Microrchidia (Morc) family of GHKL ATPases are present in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms but are of largely unknown function. Genetic screens in Arabidopsis thaliana have identified Morc genes as important repressors of transposons and other DNA methylated and silent genes. MORC1 deficient mice were previously found to display male-specific germ cell loss and infertility. Here we show that MORC1 is responsible for transposon repression in the male germline in a pattern that is similar to that observed for germ cells deficient for the DNA methyltransferase homolog DNMT3L. Morc1 mutants show highly localized defects in the establishment of DNA methylation at specific classes of transposons, and this is associated with failed transposon silencing at these sites.  Our results identify MORC1 as an important new regulator of the epigenetic landscape of male germ cells during the period of global de novo methylation. This data includes: 47 RNA-seq, 4 smRNA-seq, 6 BS-seq, and 2 ChIP-seq datasets</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - CgXII medium without furfural and with furfural stresses (each 6.5 mM, 13 mM, and 20 mM)
 Hybridization - After checking labeling efficiency, cyanine 3-labeled and cyanine 5-labeled cRNA target were combined and fragmented by adding 10X blocking agent and 25X fragmentation buffer and incubating at 60 oC for 30min. The fragmented cRNA was resuspended with 2X hybridization buffer and directly pipetted onto assembled Cryptococcus neoformans 3X20K microarray (MYcroarray.com, USA). The arrays hybridized at 57oC for 17 h using Agilent Hybridization oven (Agilent Technology, USA).
 Labeling - the synthesis of target cRNA probes and hybridization were performed using Agilent’s Low Input Quick Amp WT Labeling kit, two color (Agilent Technology, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each 0.2 ug total RNA was mixed with WT primer mix and incubated at 65 oC for 10min. cDNA master mix (5X First strand buffer, 0.1M DTT, 10mM dNTP mix, RNase-Out, and MMLV-RT) was prepared and added to the reaction mixer. The samples were incubated at 40 oC for 2 hours and then the RT and dsDNA synthesis was terminated by incubating at 70 oC for 15min. The transcription master mix was prepared as the manufacturer’s protocol (4X Transcription buffer, 0.1M DTT, NTP mix, 50% PEG, RNase-Out, Inorganic pyrophosphatase, T7-RNA polymerase, and Cyanine 3/5-CTP). Transcription of dsDNA was performed by adding the transcription master mix to the dsDNA reaction samples and incubating at 40 oC for 2 hours.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
 Scaning - The hybridization images were visualized with Axon GenePix 4000B Scanner (Axon Instrument, CA)</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - The data quantification was performed using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Axon Instrument, CA). All data normalization and the selection of fold changes were performed  using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent Technology). Intensity-dependent (Lowess)  normalization was performed, in which the ratio was reduced to the residual  of the Lowess fit for the intensity-versus-ratio curve.

      <name>Transcription profiling by array of human CD16+ and CD16- peripheral blood monocytes from healthy individuals</name>
      <description>Human peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) consist of subsets distinguished by expression of CD16 (FCGRIII) and chemokine receptors. Classical CD16- Mo express CCR2 and migrate in response to CCL2, while a minor CD16+ Mo subset expresses CX3CR1 and migrates into tissues expressing CX3CL1. CD16+ Mo produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and are expanded in certain inflammatory conditions including HIV infection. To gain insight into the developmental relationship and functions of CD16+ and CD16- Mo, we examined transcriptional profiles of these Mo subsets in peripheral blood from healthy individuals. Of 16,328 expressed genes, 2,759 genes were differentially expressed and 228 and 250 were >2-fold upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in CD16+ compared to CD16- Mo. CD16+ Mo were distinguished by upregulation of dendritic cell (DC) (SIGLEC10, CD43, RARA) and macrophage (MF) (CSF1R/CD115, MafB, CD97, C3aR) markers together with transcripts relevant for DC-T cell interaction (CXCL16, ICAM-2, LFA-1), cell activation (LTB, TNFRSF8, LST1, IFITM1-3, HMOX1, SOD-1, WARS, MGLL), and negative regulation of the cell cycle (CDKN1C, MTSS1), whereas CD16- Mo were distinguished by upregulation of myeloid (CD14, MNDA, TREM1, CD1d, C1qR/CD93) and granulocyte markers (FPR1, GCSFR/CD114, S100A8-9/12). Differential gene expression in CD16+ and CD16- Mo was confirmed by quantitative real time RT-PCR (i.e., CD16, C3AR1, C1QR1, ICAM-2, CSF1R, CSF3R, CDKN1C, TNFRSF1, and LTB) and flow cytometry (i.e., CSF1R, CSF3R, C1QR1, C3AR1, CD1d, CD43, CXCL16, and CX3CR1). Furthermore, increased expression of RARA and KLF2 transcripts in CD16+ Mo coincided with absence of cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA) expression, indicating potential imprinting for non-skin homing. These results suggest that CD16+ and CD16- Mo originate from a common myeloid precursor, with CD16+ Mo having a more MF- and DC-like transcription program suggesting a more advanced stage of differentiation. Distinct transcriptional programs, together with their recruitment into tissues via different mechanisms, also suggest that CD16+ and CD16- Mo give rise to functionally distinct DC and MF in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: Total Mo were isolated by negative selection using magnetic immunobeads (Monocyte Isolation Kit II, Miltenyi). CD16+ and CD16- Mo fractions were further isolated using CD16 magnetic immunobeads (Miltenyi). Total RNA from Mo pellets was isolated by Trizol extraction and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). The quality of RNA was assessed by visualization of intact bands corresponding to 18S and 28S rRNA on formaldehyde agarose gels. Total RNA (10 ‚àö√ᬨ¬µg) from matched CD16+ and CD16- Mo samples isolated from 4 different healthy donors was quality tested using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer chip, reverse transcribed, and hybridized on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix), which includes 54,000 probe sets on a single array (i.e., 47,000 transcripts and variants, including 38,500 well-characterized human genes). Primary data analysis performed using GeneSpring software (Biopolymer core facility, Harvard Medical School) generated Excel spreadsheets with relative gene expression values for the 4 matched CD16+ and CD16- Mo subsets.</description>

      <name>Host Age is a Systemic Regulator of Gene Expression Impacting Cancer Progression</name>
      <description>Given that aging is the major determinant of cancer incidence, and that cancer incidence is dictated in large part by processes modulating progression of existing subclinical cancers, we demonstrate that aging may be an organizing axis for identifying cancer progression-modulating processes. This would permit the broad understanding of the aging process to directly inform the question of what changes in aggregate host signaling favor cancer progression. Exploring this idea, a syngeneic murine Lewis lung cancer model in adolescent (68 days), young adult (143 days), middle-aged (551 days), and old (736 days) C57BL/6 mice was used to identify the signaling and functional processes varying significantly with host age. As anticipated, many of these specific endpoints proved to be major determinants of cancer progression. Older hosts demonstrated decreased angiogenesis, decreased metabolism and dysregulated apoptosis, all identified as hallmarks of cancer progression. Transforming growth factor 1, downregulated in older hosts, was also identified as a central player in these systemic processes. It is concluded that the strong host-age dependence here observed for tumor advancement facilitates the identification of an overarching tumor control dynamic exerted by the host. Revealed is insight into a mechanistic basis for the role of aging on modulation of tumor progression that may be therapeutically exploitable. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates, 20 tumor samples from adolescent, 10 from young adult, 10 from middle-aged, and 20 from old mice, were used. All replicate samples were run individually. Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep, and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. Data were corrected through normalization of the housekeeping genes, quantile normalized, then imported into MultiExperiment Viewer, MeV for analysis. Statistically significant genes were determined by applying a one-way ANOVA with an adjusted Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 that resulted in a list of significant genes.</description>

      <name>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of chromatin modification enzyme genes in 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mouse brain cortex</name>
      <description>The goal of this study was to identify brain cortex gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A) from SABiosciences. Mice used in this study were 4 week old males. Total RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates. For this study, cortical tissue from 3 mice of each genotype was used and RNA from the cortex of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.  The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Heterozygous MeCP2 A140V females produced in our mouse colony were bred with wild type male C57BL/6 mice to produce the male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous and wild type littermate mice used in these experiments. All breeding and experimentation was conducted in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.
 Sample Treatment - no treatment
 Hybridization - n/a
 Labeling - PCR assays were performed using the Mouse Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes Array (Catalog# PAMM-085A) from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed from 1 µg total RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (SA Biosciences). Quantitative real-time PCR using the cDNA was then performed on an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine using this protocol: 10 minutes at 95ºC followed by 40 cycles of (95ºC for 15 seconds, 55ºC for 40 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA was extracted from the somatosensory/motor cortex of 4 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mice and their male wild type littermates (n=3 for each group). TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used to extract the RNA from homogenized brain tissue. RNA was then purified using the SA Biosciences (Frederick, Maryland) RT2 qPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit. Turbo DNA-free from Ambion (Austin, Texas) was used to remove residual genomic DNA from the samples. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA for each sample using SA Biosciences RT2 First-Strand Kit.

        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - Experiments used an MJ Research Chromo4 RT-PCR machine. Ct thresholds were manually set within the linear phase of the logarithmic amplification plots using Opticon Monitor 3 software. Data from the logarithmic plots was exported and analyzed using the downloadable Excel PCR Array Data Analysis Template version 2.0 provided by SA Biosciences (http://sabiosciences.com/pcrarraydataanalysis.php). This template uses the ΔΔCt method to establish the fold change between control and experimental groups. It also uses a two-tailed student’s t test to establish statistical significance using p&lt;0.05. A set of 5 housekeeping genes (Gapdh, Actb, HSP90ab1, Hprt1, and Gusb), which are included on the array plates, was used for normalization. This was done by subtracting the average Ct value of the housekeeping genes in each sample from the Ct values of the genes of interest in that sample. The 'non-normalized.txt' reports raw Ct values before normalization. The 'fold_change.txt' reports test/control (i.e., MeCP2 A140V/wildtype) ratios [available as Series supplementary files] ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized signal (against housekeeping genes)</field>

      <name>Myxococcus xanthus cells: wild-type vs. ntrC mutant gene expression during development</name>
      <description>Transcriptional profiling of Myxococcus xanthus comparing wild-type and mutant gene expression at different developmental time points  The mutants in our study, nla4, nla18, nla6 and nla28 are strains that carry a mutation in the corresponding genes nla4 (MXAN2516), nla18 (MXAN3692), nla6(MXAN4042), and nla28(MXAN1167).  (MXAN numbers are the conventional gene names; nlas are common names).  All four of these genes are response regulators of the ntrC family of transcriptional activators. The mutations were made by insertion of a plasmid (pCR2.1TOPO, invitrogen)into the particular activator gene. Plasmids used carry a region of homology (usually 350-500 bp in length) to the sequence of the activator gene coresponding to the highly conserved central domain that is characteristic of these ntrC family of activators.  Plasmids were inserted into the chromosome via homologous recombination at the site of homology to the activator gene.  These for genes were originally identified because their mutants have phenotypes with strong defects during development. In all four cases, a mutation in the particular gene gives a phenotype with incomplete or abolished development.  In this study, the effects of these mutants were examined on developmental gene expression. Two condition experiment, normal wild-type vs mutant</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Strains were grown at 28° or 32 °C in flasks containing 350 ml of CTTYE broth [1.0% Casitone, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM MgSO4, and 0.5% yeast extract] with vigorous swiriling.  CTTYE broth was supplemented with 40 mg/ml of kanamycin sulfate as needed.
 Sample Processing - After culutres reached a density of 5 X 108 cells/ml, 40 ml aliquts of the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatants were removed, the cells were quick-frozen in dry ice/ethanol mixure, and the cells were stored at -80 °C as the vegetative (0 hour) test samples.  The cells in the remaining 350 ml culture wre pelleded by centrifugatin, the supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended in MC7 starvation buffer (10 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid [pH 7.0], 1 mM Ca cl2) to a density of 5 X 109 cells/ml.  Four ml of the concentrated cells were added to 28 ml of MC7 buffer and the cells were allowed to develop in a petri dish at 32°C.  At certain time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hours post-starvation) in development, the cells were detatched from the bottoms of the petri dishes using a cell scraper, pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were removed.  The cells were quick-frozen in dry ice/ethanol mixure, and the stored at -80° C as developmental samples.
 Hybridization - cDNA was resuspended in 9 µl of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0). The cDNA was labeled with Cy3 (Reference: mixed wild type cDNA) or Cy5 (mutant developmental cDNA) (Amersham Pharmacia) by the addition of 4.5 µl of dye dissolved in 73 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and incubated for 1 hour in the dark.
 Labeling - Fifty µg of total RNA were used to synthesize cDNA using 10 µg of pdN6 primers (Amersham Pharmacia) in the presence of 40 µg/µl RNase inhibitor (Promega)
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using the Hot-Phenol-Chloroform method (Sambrook et al., 1989) and subsequently purified using Agilent Technologies Total RNA Purification Kit</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5) representing test/reference (pooled wild-type cDNA from all developmental time points)
 Feature Extraction - LOWESS normalized, background subtracted VALUE data obtained from log2 of processed Green signal/processed Red signal.
 Image Adquisition - Post-hybridized DNA microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4100A microarray scanner and read using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Axon Inc. Union City, CA)</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">The cold shock domain is one of the most highly conserved motifs between bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Y-box-binding proteins represent a subfamily of cold shock domain proteins with pleiotropic functions, ranging from transcription in the nucleus to translation in the cytoplasm. These proteins have been investigated in all major model organisms except Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study, we set out to fill this gap and present a functional characterization of CEYs, the C. elegans Y-box-binding proteins. We find that, similar to other organisms, CEYs are essential for proper gametogenesis. However, we also report a novel function of these proteins in the formation of large polysomes in the soma. In the absence of the somatic CEYs, polysomes are dramatically reduced with a simultaneous increase in monosomes and disomes, which, unexpectedly, has no obvious impact on animal biology. Because transcripts that are enriched in polysomes in wild-type animals tend to be less abundant in the absence of CEYs, our findings suggest that large polysomes might depend on transcript stabilization mediated by CEY proteins.</field>

      <name>Differential genomic targeting of the transcription factor TAL1 in alternate hematopoietic lineages</name>
      <description>TAL1/SCL is a master regulator of hematopoiesis whose expression promotes opposite outcomes depending on the cell type - differentiation in the erythroid lineage or oncogenesis in the T-cell lineage. Here we used a combination of ChIP-sequencing and gene expression profiling to compare the function of TAL1 in normal erythroid and leukemic T-cells. Analysis of the genome-wide binding properties of TAL1 in these two hematopoietic lineages revealed new insight into the mechanism by which transcription factors select their binding sites in alternate lineages. Our study shows limited overlap in the TAL1 binding profile between the two cell types with an unexpected preference for ETS and RUNX motifs adjacent to E-boxes in the T-cell lineage. Furthermore we show that TAL1 interacts with RUNX1 and ETS1, and that these transcription factors are critically required to target TAL1 to genes that modulate T-cell differentiation. Thus, our findings highlight a critical role of the cellular environment in modulating transcription factor binding, and provide insight into the mechanism by which TAL1 inhibits differentiation leading to oncogenesis in the T-cell lineage. Examine TAL1/SCL binding sites in two different cell lineages (i.e. primary human pro-erythroblasts and the Jurkat T-ALL cell line). These records represent the ChIP-seq part of the study. The gene expresssion part is available at GSE20546.</description>

Briefly, light-density mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll density gradient centrifugation from G-CSF-mobilized adult blood from donors without hematological malignancies (Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board #2007804-01H). CD34+ cells were enriched through positive immunomagnetic selection using the CD34 MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) (purity > 95 ± 3%) and differentiated ex vivo as described in (Giarratana et al., 2005) except that we used 20% BIT (StemCell Technologies). Cells at day 10 of differentiation (corresponding to the proerythroblast stage) were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation
 Library Construction - ChIPed DNA was prepared according to the Illumina protocol with two modifications: 1) DNA fragments ranging from 150bp to 300bp were selected at the gel selection step; 2) 21 instead of 18 cycles of PCR were done at the amplification step.</field>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">TAL1/SCL is a master regulator of haematopoiesis whose expression promotes opposite outcomes depending on the cell type: differentiation in the erythroid lineage or oncogenesis in the T-cell lineage. Here, we used a combination of ChIP sequencing and gene expression profiling to compare the function of TAL1 in normal erythroid and leukaemic T cells. Analysis of the genome-wide binding properties of TAL1 in these two haematopoietic lineages revealed new insight into the mechanism by which transcription factors select their binding sites in alternate lineages. Our study shows limited overlap in the TAL1-binding profile between the two cell types with an unexpected preference for ETS and RUNX motifs adjacent to E-boxes in the T-cell lineage. Furthermore, we show that TAL1 interacts with RUNX1 and ETS1, and that these transcription factors are critically required for TAL1 binding to genes that modulate T-cell differentiation. Thus, our findings highlight a critical role of the cellular environment in modulating transcription factor binding, and provide insight into the mechanism by which TAL1 inhibits differentiation leading to oncogenesis in the T-cell lineage.</field>

      <name>Identification of Smaug target mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo using RIP-Chip</name>
      <description>To identify Smaug’s target mRNAs on a genome-wide scale we used ribonucleoprotein (RNP) co-immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis of the co-purifying mRNAs (RIP-Chip). Extracts, prepared from wild-type embryos collected 0-3 hours post-egglaying, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Smaug antibody (Smaug RIPs) while control immunoprecipitations using non-immune serum served as a negative control (control RIPs). Genome-wide transcript expression in wild-type embryos were also assessed and used as reference. There are 11 array experiments presented here: 1. gene expression profiling of total mRNA sample extracted from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 technical replicates performed using a pooled input reference sample); 2. RNA co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous Smaug (Smaug RIPs) from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 biological replicates and 1 technical replicates); 3. control RNA co-immunoprecipitations (control RIPs) from wild-type 0-3 hour embryos (3 biological replicates and 1 technical replicates).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Oregon-R wild-type fly stocks were used. All stocks were maintained at 25 °C.
 Hybridization - Labeled cDNA was used to probe Drosophila 4 x 72K NimbleGen arrays: Expression design for Drosophila melanogaster (Release 4.3) (GEO platform number: GPL13782).
 Labeling - The cDNAs were prepared following the indirect labeling protocal provided by the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre using anchored-oligo-dT primers. Cy3 or Cy5-tagged random nonamers were then used to labeled the cDNA.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Embryos collected at 0-3 hours post-egglaying were dechorionated with 50% bleach and homogenized in a minimal volume of RIP lysis buffer (150 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Bioshop)). Extracts were centrifuged for 10min at 4°C, and the supernatant was supplemented with 9 M urea to a final concentration of 2 M. Protein A beads were pre-incubated with either guinea pig anti-Smaug antibody or normal guinea pig serum followed by four washes with RIP lysis buffer supplemented with urea. These beads were then incubated with embryo extract for 2 h at 4°C followed by four washed with RIP lysis buffer supplemented with urea and RNA was extracted from the beads using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
 Scaning - The arrays were scanned using GenePix4000B microarray scanner system (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA)</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data Transformation - The raw values for the arrays were quantified using Nimblescan (Roche), following the protocol described in the NimbleGen Array User's Guide (Gene Expression Arrays, version 5.0). Arrays were normalized by Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) provided in the Nimblescan software. ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized signal intensity</field>

      <name>GATA-1 and heme regulate the erythroid cell transcriptome.</name>
      <description>Alas2 gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of two Alas2 intronic cis-elements strongly reduced GATA-1-induced Alas2 transcription, heme biosynthesis, and GATA-1 regulation of other vital constituents of the erythroid cell transcriptome. Bypassing Alas2 function in Alas2 cis-element-mutant (double mutant) cells by providing its catalytic product 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) rescued heme biosynthesis and the GATA-1-dependent genetic network. We discovered a GATA factor- and heme-dependent circuit that establishes the erythroid cell transcriptome. G1E-ER-GATA-1 WT and double mutant cells were examined. Untreated WT, beta-estradiol-treated WT, beta-estradiol-treated double-mutant, and beta-estradiol/5-ALA-treated double-mutant cells were subjected to RNA-seq.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Metal ion-containing macromolecules have fundamental roles in essentially all biological processes throughout the evolutionary tree. For example, iron-containing heme is a cofactor in enzyme catalysis and electron transfer and an essential hemoglobin constituent. To meet the intense demand for hemoglobin assembly in red blood cells, the cell type-specific factor GATA-1 activates transcription of Alas2, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase-2 (ALAS-2). Using genetic editing to unravel mechanisms governing heme biosynthesis, we discovered a GATA factor- and heme-dependent circuit that establishes the erythroid cell transcriptome. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of two Alas2 intronic cis elements strongly reduces GATA-1-induced Alas2 transcription, heme biosynthesis, and surprisingly, GATA-1 regulation of other vital constituents of the erythroid cell transcriptome. Bypassing ALAS-2 function in Alas2 cis element-mutant cells by providing its catalytic product 5-aminolevulinic acid rescues heme biosynthesis and the GATA-1-dependent genetic network. Heme amplifies GATA-1 function by downregulating the heme-sensing transcriptional repressor Bach1 and via a Bach1-insensitive mechanism. Through this dual mechanism, heme and a master regulator collaborate to orchestrate a cell type-specific transcriptional program that promotes cellular differentiation.</field>

      <name>Ribosomal footprinting and RNASeq in two strains of yeast and their diploid hybrid</name>
      <description>Heritable differences in gene expression between individuals are an important source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open. Here, we addressed this question by using ribosomal footprinting to examine how genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of genes, more than half as many as showed genetic differences in mRNA levels. Similarly, allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two strains found roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, strong effects on translation were rare, such that the direction of an mRNA difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was similar to that for mRNA levels. Across all expressed genes, there was a tendency for translation to more often reinforce than buffer mRNA differences, resulting in footprint differences with greater magnitudes than the mRNA differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation termination in the two yeast strains. Overall, genetic variation clearly influences translation, but primarily does so by subtly modulating differences in mRNA levels. Translation does not appear to create strong discrepancies between genetic influences on mRNA and protein levels. Ribsosomal footprinting and RNASeq in the two yeast strains BY and RM as well as their diploid hybrid. We generated one library each for the BY and RM parents, and two libraries (biological replicates) for the hybrid data.</description>

        <field name="pubmed_abstract">Genomic high-throughput technology generates massive data, providing opportunities to understand countless facets of the functioning genome. It also raises profound issues in identifying data relevant to the biology being studied.</field>
        <field name="pubmed_abstract">We introduce a method for the analysis of pathologic biology that unravels the disease characteristics of high dimensional data. The method, disease-specific genomic analysis (DSGA), is intended to precede standard techniques like clustering or class prediction, and enhance their performance and ability to detect disease. DSGA measures the extent to which the disease deviates from a continuous range of normal phenotypes, and isolates the aberrant component of data. In several microarray cancer datasets, we show that DSGA outperforms standard methods. We then use DSGA to highlight a novel subdivision of an important class of genes in breast cancer, the estrogen receptor (ER) cluster. We also identify new markers distinguishing ductal and lobular breast cancers. Although our examples focus on microarrays, DSGA generalizes to any high dimensional genomic/proteomic data.</field>
